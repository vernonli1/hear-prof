okay so um on Tuesday we talked about the basic theory of oligopoly and today we're going to apply it to the area where it's most commonly applied which is the control of mergers between firms and to do that we're going to start by thinking about the rationale for controlling mergers um in particular by thinking about what happens to an equilibri in a Corno industry uh when the number of firms changes um and uh in particular how prices get driven to cost as the number of firms gets large uh and then we'll generalize Beyond Corno Industries to think more broadly about how competition drives down prices and look at um some studies of how that actually happens empirically we'll then uh look at the effects of mergers between firms that like in the Corno model aren't necessarily selling the exact same product that might be selling differentiated products like in the differentiated products Nation pricing model and from that we'll derive the concept of upward pricing pressure which is commonly used to evaluate mergers in practice and then we'll talk about the legal and institutional basis in the world real world of merger control in the United States and elsewhere um and talk about some of the challenges of merger policy going forward um as usual some of the most interesting stuff will be what's left out of the approaches that people are currently taking and so we'll try to talk a little bit about that um okay so uh you guys probably remember or I hope you remember from when we talked about the correspondence principle when we did equilibrium that if an equilibrium is not stable that the comparative Statics are going to go like the opposite way that you would think they would go right so a natural question is what is the right notion of stability in the Corno equilibrium well
Equilibrium Stability you'll probably remember from Tuesday that we had these reaction function things right and they had to cross in a certain way in order for if we got a little bit away from that equilibrium things to return back to the equilibrium just as they did in uh the lecture on uh perfect competition so in particular imagine that um we start at the equilibrium and then one firm increases their quantity uh by a small amount the question is how much does that lead to a rise or fall in the optimal quantity that the other firm is going to produce Connor can you can you relate that to some concept we talk about talked about before um yeah it was the magnitude of the partial derivative of their production fun that's right and that's related in turn to remember when we talked about stackle BG when the Upstream firm increased its quantity what did the downstream firm how did that affect the quantity produced by the downstream firm they also reduce their quantity well yeah but only because the pass through rate was greater than one right so the in general it would be the pass through rate minus one which determines the amount that the other firm changes their quantity when this firm changes their quantity right um which is the same as you said of the partial derivative of the reaction function right now if um firm I increases its quantity or decreases its quantity r i Prime when firm J increases its quantity there's going to be a sort of Ripple back effect right because then that's going to affect what firm J is going to want to do too right so how much um K where's k okay uh how much is that going to lead firm J to want to change its quantity um yeah exactly so it's going to be RJ Prime Times r i Prime right so um Bob where's Bob Bob when does that make things go when when would this process go crazy like when would it keep getting bigger and bigger and get further and further away and when is it going to converge well it keeps on getting bigger and bigger if um RI is greater than one um if RI Prime you mean iser than one because it it just keeps R RJ R RJ well but what if RJ was less way very very small imagine RJ was Zero I see so basically if RI RJ RI Prime * RJ Prim is greater than one um diverges otherwise if r r j is less than one that's right ex exactly exactly Bob so what that means is that um things will be stable If the product of the slope of the two reaction functions is uh less than one so um luckily the second order condition for a monopoly turns out to be enough to guarantee that this is the case um that is so long as the marginal cost curve increases more rapidly than the marginal revenue curve does which is you know roughly like declining marginal revenue if we have constant marginal cost as we did before um then we'll get convergence right otherwise you're going to get very silly comparative Statics right one firm increasing its production could lead to a reduction in the total production uh if you don't have this uh property okay so um one firm's increasing its production should always lead total production to increase right but the question is how much does it do that by if one firm increases its production how much does the total industry production increase by can anyone tell me that Jacob well it's going to be how much the first firm increased their production by times the second firms increase or change in production so that's times your initial increase multip by R Prim yeah exactly right so the total change is RP Prime I plus one because there's an initial Change Plus how much the other firm changes there that's the one you're saying a one unit increase first exactly so um this number is called the quantity pass through rate that and that I was sort of alluding to in the last class a little bit and the reason it's called that is that it's equal to the pass through rate and I talked a little bit with people at office hours yesterday about why that's true you can look at it in the paper if you want to see the proof but I'm not going to go through it now but basically the um stability if this is the pass through rate right then the pass through rate minus one is RI Prime right and so if r i Prime Time RJ Prime is less than one right so if we have that's the same as saying that R the path through the quantity pass through uh minus minus one squared is less than one right and that's the same as that the P quantity pass through is less than two right so if you plug two into this you get two over one turns out the general stability condition is that the quantity pass through is less than n/ n minus one if you have many firms now you can't get that just purely graphically the way that we did in the um in the two firm case but uh but it's very closely uh related um so the way to see that um is that imagine that there was some increase in production and then um the whole industry if we want to figure out how much the whole industry increases its production in response to that imagine we have three firms right now each firm is going to give one half of the industry's total increase in production and what is that if we have symmetric firms right because imagine there's one firm that's the third firm it increases its production then we want to know how much do the other two firms in total increase their production right each of those firms gives one half of the change in that production which is the increase in the total industry minus the one that comes from the initial firm divided by two but we know that the um total increase in the industry production from one firm increasing its production is equal to the quantity pass through that each firm gets from the total produced by all the other firms right and how much is that well he gets one from the firm that increased its quantity plus 12 times uh dqdq Tilda minus one uh from the other firm right that's the equilibrium amount that that second firm increases its production so if we solve that out we can get that the um the amount that Quant total quantity increases when one firm increases its production is equal to row Q over 2us row q and more generally you get the formula that it's row Q Over N over n minus1 * row q and that's how you derive that stability uh is given by this formula because if you just apply the same thing to imagining that one firm increases its quantity and then the other whole group of other firms you want to know how they react and you sort of have it go back and forth between them if that converges that means that the thing is going to be stable if that diverges it's going to be unstable okay so the most important point is that whenever quantity increases and the equilibrium is stable this is going to be positive that is one firm increasing its quantity leads the total industry quantity to increase and that's very intuitive um it's very much related to what we were saying before about the correspondence principle that you get the comparative Statics going in the natural direction as long as the equilibrium is stable right okay so that means that if a new firm comes into the industry what does that correspond to well that firm was previously outside of the industry so they were producing zero and now they're going to enter the industry and increase their quantity up to whatever the equilibrium quantity is that everybody else is producing that's effectively one firm raising its production right so um how do we know that a new firm entering the industry is going to impact the total production in the industry Justin oh so if a new firm enters the industry how is that going to in change the total production in the industry just from the reasoning we were doing before um because zero am yeah and everyone reacts to them inre well not necessarily they could actually decrease theirs right but what we do know for sure is what um total am yeah the total amount produced by the industry will increase when one firm enters and therefore increases its production right so this increased production of course drives down prices and that means that enter a new firm entering the industry makes it more competitive and that's true in general in the Corno model So eventually as more and more firms enter we're going to get towards perfect competition so let's consider a simple example that illustrates that so imagine that we know that we know that each firm in a Corno industry produces where the derivative of where price plus their production times the slope of price is equal to cost right and by symmetry we know that each firm has one over n of the total production in the industry right and so that means that we have this equation here right now um Charlie Charlie Charlie can you convert this into an elasticity what is going to be the formula for pricing in terms of elasticities uh analogous to the one that we learned before in class Monopoly do it on the what what was the rule for elasticities in pricing that we had before in Monopoly you remember do you want to try to do it on the board then or I'm like I'm blinking on what what's it start well you want to figure out what the optimal price for the firm is in terms of the elasticity of its demand so we had the is that the the one related to intellectual property no when we did Monopoly right we said that an optimal price for the firm was related to the elasticity of its Demand right yeah okay I don't remember does anyone want to try doing that yeah chy sure you can you can go on that board for example so I guess we have formula here Q total quantity over number of firms MH so we um elasticity have something to do with the derivative here yeah so we're first going to take out P of Q here so that looks like yeah and that means P of Q parth one and and elasticity is just DQ Q DP P exactly and we can rearrange this fraction into d p p d yeah and so we can only one slight thing which is that for elasticity of demand which is always negative right you have to have a negative sign out there right so that's actually so we'll actually have to write P of qal * 1us the elasticity over one and times uh number ofm one over number of firms that so this gives us okay something this elasticity number c so are we trying to solve for elasticity or well so the um that that's that's good enough Changi uh what what we did in the previous class um was that we converted that into the learner rule right where the markup divided by the price was equal to the inverse of the elasticity so here the markup divided by the price is equal to the 1/n times the elasticity of Demand right and that's a general formula for Corno so imagine we had the constant elasticity case that we were dealing with in the previous class um what's going to happen Jacob as the number of firms increases markup has to go to zero exactly price cost exactly so as competition increases price gets driven down to cost and quantity becomes the efficient quantity just to make sure you guys got this let's try another example so imagine demand were given by this linear form here so um saying saying can you derive the equilibrium equation in this case when there's n firms first you have to find margin Rue yeah yeah you have to invert that another way you could do it if you want is you could use this formula here you could find the elasticity of demand and then you don't have to invert any anything if you want I mean it's up to you so you find the elasticity by yeah yeah so you multip p p yeah and Q is given by this expression here right you can do it on the boorder on your paper p 2us p negative p over 2 m minus P that sounds right um and then what does this equation tell us it tells us that P minus C over p is equal to 1 n time the elasticity right so can you now solve out for the price as a function of so P minus C by the way remember that you have to put a negative in front of the elasticity because it's always a negative number yeah p 2 p - 2 m uh so what does that give us as the final expression for p c 2 that's C you said CM yeah c 2 yeah that sounds right uh let's see so the price equation what I did here is I turned this as you were originally proposing um saying into price is equal to this we take the derivative of price we multiply that by Qi to get the marginal Surplus right we add that to the price to get um the marginal revenue set that equal to cost and we get the equation that 2 m time this is equal to C right now notice that as n goes to Infinity we have that um this becomes price equals cost right and so even without explicitly solving for the price as you did we can see that the price is going to be driven down to cost as the number of firms gets large right okay so this suggests a more General result which is probably the most fundamental result in all of industrial organization it says that as the number of competing firms grows arbitrarily large the price converges to marginal cost um and this is sort of the foundation of the concept of perfect competition if there's a large LGE number of firms firms act effectively as if they're price takers it's also the basis for most Anti-Trust and competition policy because which tries to increase the amount of competition increase the number of firms to try to drive down prices and this can be shown to hold much more broadly if we have nonlinear costs if there's asymmetric firms as long as we have stable equilibria um demand can satisfy weaker regularity conditions the key point is just that when there's a large number of firms each individual firm is going to have a small production because the total production in the industry can't be that large and that's going to reduce the optimal markup for each firm which is equal to P Prime Times the derivative times the quantity that each firm has right okay now suppose that we have Bertrand competition instead with homogeneous products but that firms have a distribution of costs now that could either be competing in industry or it could be like an auction where I say here's how much I'm willing to pay for the good given that my value for it is a certain amount right now basically the optimal thing for a firm to do just as it would be in an auction would be to try to guess the price that the next highest bidder is going to bid given that you are going to bid a certain amount right because you just want to beat that guy right you don't want to beat him by a lot because then you're wasting money you don't want to lose uh if it's worth beating him if he's bidding less than you okay so what you do is you bid the expectation that you have of the second highest biders uh conditional on you winning and that's the same thing you would do in berran competition with heterogeneous costs so you would set your price at exactly what you expect the person with the second lowest cost to have as their cost if you have the lowest cost um okay so you try to just beat the next guy now that's only true if the demand in the market is completely in elastic if the demand in the market is elastic you'll respond to that a little bit but you get something pretty similar in general now imagine that we have something like this what's going to happen as the number of firms in the industry grows Ryan you think that since there's more people there going to be you're going to try to be more people bying your cost slightly lower as people so event get really close to your own cost yeah that's right because the um people are going to if there's more people the next highest person is likely to be closer to you right and therefore people are going to sort of be breathing down your neck more forcing you to do something closer to your cost right and so in the limit this expectation converges to the cost of the lowest person which is the lowest uh cost that anyone could draw right the intuitive reason is that as the number of firms gets large any individual firm is less necessary to the market and therefore it's you know sort of easier for the auctioneer to extract more Revenue uh everyone is being forced to bid as much as the next best person right and if there are more people people are getting closer and closer yeah Jacob so we're we're assuming some other firms will have cost close to that firm yeah so I'm assuming here that the cost will be drawn randomly or something like that but there was like one firm that was way lower than El then it would converg to Second yeah whatever was the yeah I mean it would always be with the second lowest guy was and you know you could imagine that we have a world a little bit like we talked about when we did the fat tailed things where the top person is so much better than the next best person if we were in that sort of a world then you wouldn't really get convergence you could actually get it getting further and further away even though you're getting a higher and higher quality good yeah David the firms that can't produce that cost do they still continue producing at their own cost or they they well in betrand only one firm produces right because it's Whoever has the lowest price so yeah they all exit Okay so again in a different setting we obtain a conversion of cornos theorem so prices gradually converge to the constant marginal cost of the lowest cost firm um now if not all firms had constant marginal cost then everyone would um then we need everyone producing different quantities but in the limit this also becomes efficient because everyone takes as given everybody else's uh price right and they produce up to the point where their marginal cost is equal to that price and that price gets G driven down towards the marginal cost of every firm and so you get um you get uh convergence to perfect competition there as well so that basically says that in a very different model we get the same basic result and thus we can sort of take this as a general rule about competition which is that eventually as the number of firms gets large but not immediately as we have a couple of firms competi gets driven down to cost and that with enough firms prices should be efficient or very close so a natural question though is exactly how many firms in practice do you need before you basically get all the benefits from competition so bresnahan uh Tim bresnahan and Peter race found an interesting way of trying to study this and their idea was that as the number of firms grows larger a market is able to support more firms so think about a small town there's probably only one doctor there hid Park there's only a few restaurants in Lake View there's a lot of restaurants right because there's more people living there right so let's call the number of people that's needed before you get um n firms capital S suben and let's call the number of people that you need per firm in order to get end firms little s subn so that's capital S subn Over N right so that's the number of customers per firm needed before you get a certain number of firms now notice that if the firm's prices didn't change as the number of firms increased then this would just be a flat thing right if the number of because that would be um saying that because people aren't going to enter the industry until they can cover their fixed cost right if prices stay the same as the number of firms increases the number of customers you need to cover your fixed cost is constant right on the other hand if prices fall as more firms enter the industry right then you're going to need more customer customers per firm to have two firms than to have one firm and more customers per firm to have three firms than to have two firms right because in order to cover your fixed cost if the price has fallen you need to have a larger quantity does that make sense okay yeah so S3 should be greater than S2 should be greater than S1 sorry about that another reason why this could occur is because of heterogeneity now so imagine like one person really wants to live in this town and another person is sort of willing to move live in this town another person would have to be paid a lot to move to this town well then that would also lead to this sort of a pattern right but imagine everyone has the same fixed cost of entering then then we get this pattern and in fact we can infer the amount by which the prices are changing from these s variables right okay so what presan and race did is they found
Convergence Perfect Competition five professions in many rural towns in the United States and they asked um how many people and how many professionals were in each town and in particular when does these when do these s's start to level out rather than being increasing when do they start to level out and he interpreted this as convergence to they interpreted this as convergence to perfect competition they found that this happened when there were about three to five professionals so here I've graphed S5 / s subn where n goes from 0 to one to two now if this thing is increasing right if it increases the number of firms increases then this should be decreasing within because this is one over s subn effectively right and what you find is that once you have three firms you're very close to leveling out at the value that you'll eventually get so pretty much somewhere between three and five firms you get all the benefits that competition's eventually going to give you um most of the benefit comes from getting the second firm but there's still quite a bit from getting the third and very little from then on okay so uh that gives you a sense for how quickly competition sets in at least in these contexts and under these assumptions but it's a nice sort of piece of data about that okay so so far um we've been assuming that there's just one product for all the firms right we were in this uh homogeneous products model right but in reality many firms
Removing Competition that compete with each other have imperfect substitutes right and the question is how does the removal of of competition in that context affect prices well a natural question is what do we even mean by competition right it's not so easy to just think about adding another firm because every firm has a different product right so one natural way to think about removing competition is if there's two firms that are selling different products that then merge with each other and treat um their joint sales of their two products s uh as their profit right so let's consider the simplest situ uh version of this situation let's imagine there are two firms and they have linear demand like we got from the hoteling model right so each firm's
Optimal Price demand is Alpha minus beta times their own price plus gamma times the price of the other firm um what is going to be the optimal price for each firm this situation if they have a common constant cost C leis can you do that um remember how we find the optimal price under linear demand do you remember that anyone else want to remind us J well you could solve for it that way Lis do you want to try solving for it that way uh setting equal to marginal cost yeah setting marginal revenue equal to marginal cost for this do that you sure so that would be so marginal Rue would be the derivative of Pi * Qi yeah plus P right yeah please you can erase that there do you want an eraser so that's marginal revenue right oh P I was just writing Revenue that's Pi Qi plus P well I I was I was asking R revenues in this case is just Pi 10 Qi y so that's right great so just taking this the derivative respect to PI right um right or sorry with respect to Qi oh you you'd want to do if you want to get marginal revenue but you could also just maximize profits if you want because if you just subtract from this cost times Qi then that would just be maximizing profits so in fact you could just do replace this with pi minus C right yeah because that'll be the total profits right because this is if you put parentheses around this then this is your quantity and this is your markup right and then maximize this yeah sure there's actually a minus in front of the beta oh yeah why is there two gamma oh but this is PJ oh that's the price of the other guy yeah okay you just have thisal to zero yep but You' missed the C it was multiplied by C so you also have to have a beta this is par yeah exactly so you have a minus beta time C or plus beta time C great now solve for pi yeah yeah except that it's a plus because there's a plus but yes absolutely great job Lis um so uh another way to see the formula that Lewis got is remember we always price halfway up the demand curve under linear demand so weird is the where's the top of the demand curve Alpha plus gamma PJ but then we also put in half of the cost right and the beta is cancel here so that you you have cost over two right so that's a a simpler way if you remember that trick for doing linear demand okay so by symmetry the other firm is going to have the same price that's what the trick we used on Tuesday right and so we can make the these both be P here and then subt and then this becomes P * 1 - gamma / 2 Beta is equal to Beta C over 2 plus Alpha over 2 Beta um and so on what would be the equilibrium price just solving this equation here this equation here for P oh I'm sorry so this is the equation for the equilibrium price right because we derived the optimal price by the firm and then we had that the prices were symmetric and so these were both the price and so we subtracted this from these two sides we got price * 1 - gamma over 2 Beta is equal to Beta C+ Alpha over 2 Beta And so how do we what's the solution for the equilibrium price a b SE minus gamma yep absolutely exactly so this is the formula now imagine that the two firms merge right now once the firms have merged their products are symmetric right so they can treat them as if there's just one product right and they're going to set the same price for the two products and then their quantity is going to be 2 * Alpha minus beta minus gamma time P right now Joe can you tell me what the optimal price is maybe just using the same logic of the linear demand curve that we got from before what linear be halfway up yeah price You' have to Inver that Sol for p and two yeah so it's just the gam just it's it's Alpha divided beta minus gamma right because if this halfway down the demand curve is where going all the way down the demand curve is when there's no Demand right and that would be when p is equal to Alpha over beta minus gamma so we go halfway there so that's Alpha beta minus gamma * 2 right and then we also add half of the cost to that right so we get um Alpha over 2 * beta minus gamma plus C over2 okay so if we use Mathematica to take the difference between this thing and that thing we get that it's 12 time G gamma over beta- gamma time Alpha - beta- gamma c/ 2 beta- gamma okay what why on Earth did I choose to write this formula this way well there are basically three key terms in here first gamma over beta minus gamma is a measure of how intensely the two firms are competing Connor wh why is that um because it's um as P increases it'll decrease or increase the demand depending on that's the ratio of those effect exactly so this is the ratio of how much demand my competitor gains when I increase my price to how much we both lose when we increase our price right so that's like what fraction of the total demand that's lost goes to my rival right so that's a measure of how intensely we're competing
Markup this is the merger is the markup prior to the merger can um Justus can you explain why this is the firm's markup prior to the merger this is the firm's price prior to the merger right so why is this the markup prior to the merger I'm not sure well how do we get mark up if we have price what is markup yeah so what do you get if you subtract cost from this this minus are you saying that top equation is this top thing here this is the Prem merger price subtract cost from that and what do you get oh that yeah sorry exactly so you subtract cost from this you subtract two BS off of that you add one gamma time C and you get this right and one half we know is the pass through rate under Monopoly under sorry linear demand okay so this shows three factors that show up much more broadly when we analyze a merger so let's focus on the first two for the moment so imagine that burger King buys McDonald's right why would this lead Burger King to increase the prices on its Burgers Lewis intuitively so cost and they would pass through that cost well but that's a fixed cost it's not a marginal cost right so the question is what's the marginal cost of selling burgers that's created for Burger King when it's bought McDonald's they have to switch over production well imagine there's nothing like that they're just being operated together does anyone else have a thought um how about David Wayne um well now that uh yeah that I think you're on the right track Joe do you want to elaborate on that um because previously when McDonald's was a competitor they had take to account the fact that when they raised their price that would push some people to McDonald's but that McDonald's is part of Burger King that's kind it's it's internalized so then they can yeah they before they didn't take into account the fact that every time they raised their price that was actually benefiting their competitor but now they do take that into account they internalize that externality right um and so let's call the size of
Diversion Ratio that the diversion ratio between Burger King and McDonald's that is the fraction of people who when you raise your price and therefore less people buy from you go and buy from your Ral so like every person who comes in and buys a Burger King burger if they didn't have the access to the Burger King Burger they might have chosen to buy a McDonald's burger they might have chosen to go to KFC right the diversion ratio is the fraction of the people who when they don't get access to the Burger King Burger go to McDonalds rather than somewhere else right that's called the diversion ratio from Burger King to McDonald's now how costly is that to Burger King well the marginal profit that they gain when somebody goes to McDonald's is just the markup that McDonald's is charging right because that's the benefit to McDonald's of having one more customer right so once they merge uh this becomes a loss to Burger King every time it sells a burger every time Burger King sells a burger it thinks to itself if I hadn't sold that burger then the some fraction of those people would have gone to McDonald's and I would have earned that markup on them so that's an opportunity cost to Burger King of selling a burger right so the
Upward Pricing Pressure new opportunity cost that is increased is equal to the diversion ratio from Burger King to McDonald's times the markup of McDonald's right and this is called the upward price pressure that is exerted on Burger King from the merger they have a pressure to increase their price they have this new cost that leads them to want to increase their price as a result of them having merged right and this exactly corresponds to the factors in our example right this was the diversion ratio the ratio of how many people I increase the other guys by minus how much uh I changed my own production and this was the markup right okay so the upward pricing pressure of up is the diversion ratio multiplied by the markup um then the question is at what rate does an increase in cost translate into an increase in the prices that consumers actually pay what do we call that uh chairman oh hey man um what do we call what do we call the rate at which a increase in cost translates into an increase in price exactly right so we multiply how much the firm's cost increase by the pass through rate to figure out how much they actually increase prices right um okay so multiplying the up by the pass through rate gives us the change in price induced by the merger right um okay now imagine that we want to figure out how much that impacts consumer welfare how much worse off our consumers as a result of that Jackson how would we do that U so you would you want to multiply um how much more consumers are going to be PID um the number of consumers exactly by the quantity that they're purchasing right because remember that by the envelope theorum by uh hoteling's Lemma I don't know exactly what you guys called it the amount that an increasing prices hurts consumers is the quantity that they're purchasing right okay um so this gives us a relatively simple methodology for predicting merger effects you need to measure uh the diversion ratio which can often be done in a variety of ways so one way is that you can look for internal documents within the company that say oh who do we think our closest competitors are how who do we think we're going to lose the most sales too um uh you can also look at in auctions what are called win loss studies which are um if we're competing in an auction how often is it the case that when I lose the auction you beat you just beat me how often was I the next highest person a second approach is to use survey data survey consumers and say if you couldn't go here where where else would you go what would be your
Survey Data second best choice or you can use data from the internet to do that people who bought this or were likely to buy this often bought this other thing right or you can use uh econometrics and what's called demand estimation another approach that I was just reading about which is kind of interesting is I don't know if you've ever seen that some brands of products use what's called comparative advertising where they say oh you know tide is much better than um uh what's the other leading uh uh detergent Bounty yeah tide is much better than Bounty right well they would only do that if they were close competitors right because they only do it if they thought they would get a lot of business from the other guys right so another way you could measure it is you could look at how much comperative advertising they do about each other so that'll tell you something about how close substitutes they are for one another um and that lets you measure the diversion ratio the markup you can get just by looking at uh how much the firm's markups are um and then the pass through rate can be harder to get but you can use some of the other things that are affected by the pass through rate uh like you know how much firm's prices went up when costs went up in the past okay so that's how in the modern world um people analyze mergers so in fact if any of you guys ever decide to go work for the summer or for permanently for an economic consultancy or for the US government antitrust division you will spend your whole life doing exactly this looking at this sort of data and trying to figure out what all this stuff is now the reason that that's the case is that in the United States there's a law called The Clayton Antitrust Act the Sherman Antitrust Act which we talked about on Tuesday prevents firms from colluding with each
Clayton Act other and forming illegal cartels whereas The Clayton Act regulates legal agreements between firms and in particular it subjects any two firms that want to merge to a review by the government to see whether it's okay that they merge now um Jacob why don't we just block all mergers I mean there's usually an efficiency the example we have or sometimes there's no the sub additivity argument sometimes there's economies of scale so it's actually more efficient for companies to merge through C exactly so one example of that would be that you know AT&T was recently um arguing that it should be allowed to merge with uh with uh T-mobile because it would allow people to have access to better reception on the network because it could be shared between T-Mobile and AT&T right and you have to weigh this against the anti-competitive effect right um and the Authority for doing this is shared between many different agencies of the federal government but Lesley what are the two agencies that have the primary responsibility for this um they wrote the reading that you were supposed to do for this class I forgot exactly does anyone remember uh Andy the Trade Commission and the Department of Justice yeah that's right um and uh basically if two companies want to merge they need to pre- notify these agencies of their intention to merge in fact the agencies have like a working group that clears all this stuff
Mergers and they have to notify that group that they're going to merge and then the agency aa's data in several stages so this massive number of Mer merger cases comes in every year maybe 10,000 and like 90% of them they just say that's fine you can merge no problem and then 10% of them they say we're going to look into that more send us some more information about what you're doing and so then they have to file a longer thing and the agency has one month to respond and say do you guys want are you still worried about this so again 90% of what remains they'll say that's just fine and then you're left with sort of 1% of all mergers where they say we're worried about this uh send us all your internal information uh all the data that you have and we are going to have six months to take a look at this so that so then they spend six months looking at it and at the end probably about 50% of the time they say that's fine go ahead and then about half of the remaining times they say no way we're not letting you do this and then but half of the remaining times they say okay we're willing to let you go ahead but um you have to divest some of your assets so for example um you could have in the AT&T and T-Mobile merger said look there are certain parts of the country where you guys are competing really heavily we're not going to let you acquire those parts of T-Mobile we're only going to let you acquire the parts where you're not competing too heavily um and then with the ones that they block entirely most of those just say okay if you're going to block us we give up some of them say no we really want to merge still we're going to take it to court and then there's a fighting Court over it now to do this these agencies have about 150 PhD economists from places like Chicago who go and do empirical analysis to try to make this determination okay in some ways antitrust regulation is probably the most sophisticated area of economic regulation in the world that uses the most sophisticated set of economic tools and it's been copied by most developing countries by most developed countries and by some developing countries so the European commission is now a major leader in this they used to not have any any antitrust regulation basically and now they do something very similar to what the US does the UK Australia and New Zealand are even further ahead and copy that even earlier um uh and the interesting thing is this structure didn't really get set up till the early ' 80s so it's been a very quick process of people copying it because the regulation was thought to be so sophisticated now this sort of policy is much more primitive and unstructured in the developing World in many countries there's no laws that even exist and in fact in Peru until recently I'm not sure whether it's passed yet but I've been working with the provian government on a law for uh trying to um uh prevent mergers uh but per Peru used to have no law against mergers any firms could merge that wanted to in other countries there's a law but there's minimal infrastructure so one example of that is that apparently there's some African country I think like Zambia or something like that that apparently has the most stringent antitrust laws in the world but no merger has ever actually been blocked and they don't even have an office that's in charge of looking into it because apparently like there's some development funds that are linked to like the text of your antitrust law so they put in antitrust law and then never did anything with it um there's others that have a structure but limited economic analysis so Colombia is the government that I've been working with that while they have a formal um agency in place and they have a review process they don't have any PhD economists working there they're all just people have Masters or whatever and a few try to be more sophisticated so China Brazil and Chile are developing countries that have quite sophisticated antitrust infrastructures so it's obviously very heterogeneous across the world and to me it's a shame that most of industrial organization which is the field that studies this type of stuff um is focused on antitrust policy in developed countries but antitrust in developed countries is already working pretty well and um there are some details about exactly how you measure whatever but it's sort of details I think what's much more important is getting things right in places where there really is no antitrust infrastructure right now so I think the issue of industrial organization and developing countries is a really important topic for research now the traditional way starting in the 1980s that um mergers were evaluated was based on what was called industry concentration and in order to do this analysis the whole Market regardless of how different the products were were all effectively treated as a single product or market and King Solomon how did they do that um well you can take like for instance like apple creates you know a music section and a phone section and like a tablet section but you can just call that all kind of electronics so you just take yeah um sort of like generally related things and consider them all the same and do you remember the test that was used to determine what products belong in a market and what products don't belong in the market uh um does anyone remember that from the yeah Connor hypothetical monopo how does that work um so they had a lot of complicated statistical data but they basically asked like what would happen if they R if one of the firms increas their price by 5% and they to the other yeah so what they do is they um have to figure out which product should be added to the market so what they do is they start with the two merging products so if famous example of this was Whole Foods and Wild Oats merged uh a few years ago so there was a case being determined about that and they said okay what is the right market right is it Gourmet organic grocery stores is it Gourmet Grocery Stores not just organic is it all grocery stores right so what they did is they tried they start with the two firms that are merging and then they add products to the market adding the ones that are most closely substitutable with the products until they reach a point where a hypothetical monopolist who controlled all those thing all those products would um have an incentive to impose a small but significant and non-transitory increase in prices or what's called a snap um so what does that mean well the Supreme Court said a small but significant and non-transitory increase in prices is the test and how does the antitrust agencies Implement that 5% increase in prices for one year so that's the definition of small but significant and then non-transitory is one year um yeah Charlie is that arbitrary yes I've never seen anyone do anything to justify why this is a good standard but that's an interesting question if there would be any way to do that um so you asked yourself the question okay if I controlled all organic premium grocery stores would I have an incentive to increase prices by 5% over one year for at least one year if I controlled all organic if I controlled all Gourmet Grocery Stores not necessarily organic would I have an incentive to increase prices by 5% for at least one year etc etc that's the analysis that you do then once you've defined that industry you try to measure the concentration of that industry and what's the typical measure of concentration that's used Ryan uh the hhi index what's that basically take percent yeah exactly so this is called the hendall hman index after two economists hendall and Herman and you let the share of each firm be the fraction of sales it has of the total market and then the hhi is the sum of the squares of the shares sometimes multiplied by 10,000 not 1,000 um now notice that if you have five firms and they all have the same share right then the hhi will be exactly equal to the share of every firm or the share of every firm multiplied by 10,000 right and we know from the Pres H and race study that competition starts to get in danger when there are less than say three to five firms so that would correspond to an hhi of somewhere between 3,300 uh and 2,000 right now there's also some other justifications uh of this that are based on collusion or on a Corno analysis of the industry so um in particular the difference between price and the um marginal cost of a firm remember is equal to the derivative of price times the quantity in Cornell right sry the negative of that which is price over the elasticity of demand that's this thing multiplied by the firm's share in the industry now um we know that price over elasticity uh oh sorry so then if we sum this up across all the firms in the industry right we get that if we uh and weight by the shares of the firms so we take the share weighted average markup of the firms that will be equal to the hhi divided by the elasticity and so that's sort of like a measure of effectively how many firms there are in the industry okay so um bresnan and race would say that we should start worrying when this gets above about 2,000 or about 3,300 the agencies end up being much more conservative than that so in particular they ended up worrying about any merger that caused the hhi to get above 1,800 or that led it to increase by 300 okay unfortunately that this approach proved very cumbersome and the reason was just take the example of Whole Foods and Wild Oats that we were giving everything was zer1 there either like all supermarkets needed to be included or you needed to treat them as if they weren't competing at all with Whole Foods and Wild Oats and that's just silly right I mean Whole Foods and Wild Oats are better substitutes for each other than they are for other Gourmet supermarkets better substitutes for Gourmet supermarkets than they are for all supermarkets but why would you want to just like put some things completely inside and some things totally outside right um the relevance of concentration is also somewhat ambiguous so it if you think about it actually um in a Corno industry the best mergers are the ones where concentration increases the most after the merger why is that well a merger is good if the firm's increase their production not decrease their production the things you're worried about is firms merge and then they decrease their production right so actually a merger that increases concentration by a lot could actually be a beneficial merger because the big firm that's merging is increasing its production right so the merger guidelines issued by the agencies have started to move away from these things of market definition which is how they started in the early 80s um um these guidelines are the official policy of how the agencies evaluate mergers and they are given as guidance to businesses so businesses can figure out if a proposed merger that they are thinking about is likely to be viewed as anti-competitive by the agencies or Pro competitive and these have been issued roughly every 10 years since 1980 the most recent one was in 2010 and I was pretty closely involved with the development of that in the um us as well as with the process that went on in year United Kingdom in the same year to produce a new set of guidelines now the 19 the guidelines through 1992 were all based on hhi and market definition and the new ones emphasize Instead This logic that I was giving about up the diversion ratio multiplied by the markup okay these were designed by Carl Shapiro and Joe Ferell who are two economists at Berkeley who were the creators of up and then uh were supporters of Obama and then got put in as the head of the doj and the FDC antitrust economics divisions uh during the Obama Administration work together to create these new guidelines but every 10 years these things get revised to and updated to reflect the latest um things in economics so for example the UK just issued a report on how to include conjectural variations in thinking about merger policy and thinking about collusion um which was not included in that up analysis uh and they may in their next revision incorporate some stuff like that okay so um Jacob can you think of some key uh considerations that you would want to think about in evaluating a merger that's that are left out of the things we've talked about so far well just of anything that we've talked about in the lecture so far one thing that the um the horiz mer guid brought efficiencies yeah you want to know if it will be more efficient custom together that's right we talked about that a little bit before but can you think of anything else that we didn't include um one thing I was thinking about before was in terms of that diversion yeah the up the amount that is going to be diverted depends a lot on your initial concentration in your firm M because the example we had before was there were only two firms but if there are a bunch then the amount your customers that go to say Burger King is going to be a lot smaller so your upper pricing pressure will be much smaller but see the diversion ratio summarizes all of that right sort of some I mean that's an input to figure out the diversion ratio but the great thing about the diversion ratio is you don't have to worry about the defining the industry because all those things come into DET determining the diversion ratio how about um fix cost entering the IND industry because if you maybe you make a very much more concentrated industry in the short term firm could then come in and undercut you if you raised your price easily then you have that's the concern for entry right so the analysis is usually based on the firms currently in the industry but you might also want to think about potential competitors who could come in in response to an increase in prices another issue is uh nonprice effects so for example changes in your product quality or your product range or the spense effects we were talking about right um the effect on Innovation by the firms or another question right we said that concentration might be beneficial or potentially harmful for Innovation so that could be another effect right another issue could be buyer power right imagine that the buyers of the good are themselves concentrated well then your power might actually offset theirs a little bit and it's not so obvious that things are so bad unfortunately most of these things don't show up in the current guidelines sorry these things things show up in the current guidelines but many other things that are important don't show up in the current guidelines for example current guidelines don't talk at all about pass through obviously that's important as we said right they don't talk about um the fact that uh if we have so I mentioned that we might say not just that you guys can or cannot merge but that you have to divest certain parts of your business bus right and really there should be a separate analysis done for every intervention that we could do to try to solve the problem to figure out which markets are the problematic ones right and that uh would be I think a natural thing to put in the analysis another issue is you know we said that Monopoly power is important not just because of the distortions that it causes to production or how much it hurts consumers but it can also be beneficial or harmful based on which firms it incentivizes to enter the industry or not the profits you can gain from a merger should be treated in the same way and that's not included in the guidelines right now another issue is that if firms merge they might become too big to fail or necessary to bail out if they're too big in the industry and that gives bad incentives and so you might want to stop firms from becoming too big that way too another uh thing like that and this was on an old problem set is political power if firms merge together they're going to become more politically power powerful you might want to prevent that from happening so they can't manipulate and Lobby the government too much right so all these things I think are important issues that aren't included in the guidelines and are great topics to consider for research like in a BA thesis anyway uh thank you guys and I'll see you on Tuesday for the last class good luck working on the problem set
