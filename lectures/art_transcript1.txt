welcome to art history 309g non-western art i'm travis lee clark and i'm the lecturer for this course let me just get into this and tell you a little bit about myself i got my phd from temple university where i worked on christian manuscripts in places like the vatican and st catharines monastery so you may be asking yourself how is it that a person who started work on you know christian medieval manuscripts wound up teaching non-western art well let me get into this uh here i am in my best indiana jones cosplay standing in front of saint catherine's monastery saint catherine's monastery is uh in the middle of the sinai desert this is the location where moses saw the burning bush according to christian tradition uh as it turns out the real miracle is not that he saw a burning bush it's that he saw a bush at all uh the sinai is a very desolate so desolate it makes utah look like the cambodian rainforest by comparison but all of that dry weather is very good for preserving manuscripts like this one this is the one i wrote my dissertation on the christian topography but one of the things that fascinated me about st catharines is that it was this crossroads of cultures that came together let me grab my pen and right behind my big old fat head here you'll see this is the church this is the bell tower this is the christian church that continues to serve this monastery but right next to it is a minaret and that's a minaret to a mosque and so we have two places of worship here write immediately adjacent to each other one is muslim and one is christian the monks of course are there to pray to write in manuscripts and dedicate themselves to god but they have a lot of other things that have to be taken care of and there's not enough monks to do it and so muslims have moved in and built a community there as well and are part of the monastery it's a really interesting example of how cultures kind of can get along even though we don't necessarily think of these cultures getting along pretty much from the 7th century this region has been under the control of muslims and yet the christian monastery has continued to exist and in fact drive under that period so as i was doing a lot of research in you know places like egypt jordan turkey uh these were mostly predominantly muslim countries and i was there studying christian medieval art it struck me that i ought to know a little bit about muslim art and so one of my areas that i started to branch out into was islamic art and of course i started studying it and immediately fell in love with it and of course i being a manuscript guy i really fell in love with muslim manuscripts this is one of my favorite islamic manuscripts this is a manuscript that comes from the safavid period in persia and this is the book of kings the shana ma it's this great epic story it's not a great it's the great epic story of persian folklore and civilization this one is a miniature yes it's a tiny little illustration but when you look at the detail it's just gobsmacking the artist practically went blind doing this but it's just absolutely rich this is gay umar's gay omar's is the first man in the persian story and here he is deciding which of his two sons to bestow the kingdom upon and this is so early that you can see that they don't even have clothes they don't have cloth they're wearing animal skins it's a fabulous little detail by the artist but look at the beautiful rocks and vegetation and clothes i mean it's just amazing the swirling clouds it's drawing influence from as far east as china in the tang and the song dynasties and also mongolian art it's really incredible and so again it too is an example of how cultures come together and they blend i was really fascinated by this and so islamic art is one of my main areas that i teach in but as it turns out i also got quite a bit of an education in indian art in south and asian art one of my professors at temple university was kurt barron kirk baron is currently a assistant curator for asian collections in the metropolitan museum of art in new york city and his area of expertise was on gandaran statues and gandharan statues are of course these beautiful statues that come from afghanistan it's not a place we normally think of as being a buddhist country but once upon a time it was a major source of buddhist art and so we have this unique blending of east and west there as well well uh time moved on and catastrophe happened i actually graduated and then i had to get one of these things called a job so i actually went to my first job interview and i was really uh wanting to you know continue eating living indoors all the usual things that people have expectations of and i went to a small college a liberal arts college in far west texas called solraw state and while i was there in the middle of the interview they asked a question but they asked the wrong question they said we would really like someone to teach latin american art and my heart dropped because i was like oh crap i you know i've never taught latin american art but then they asked the wrong question they said can you teach latin american art not have you taught latin american art but they said can you it's very important to listen to that uh distinction and i said yes i can knew nothing about latin american art didn't have a clue what i was doing but i spent the summer i pulled every book i could on latin american art and wouldn't you know it they have manuscripts too this is just fabulous manuscripts and so i studied really hard and i started teaching latin american art there and i wasn't very good at it at first but i totally fell in love with it and so i actually got a third area of non-western experience which was pretty remarkable these are a set of mishika and mishtech codices that were created in the 16th century so you have the conquest after the conquest naha speaking peoples and and aztec and mashika peoples reclaim their identity and create these beautiful this one shows uh warriors with their mach wheedles there's these obsidian lined clubs we also have beautiful objects like this this one shows the migrations of the mashika peoples from chico mostak this uh legendary cave and i love how you can see their footprints to show how they are uh you know coming out of the cave shows their migrations really beautiful stuff and my favorite period of latin american art had to be a late 16th and 17th century um vice regal new spain vice versa as the colonial period and if you went to mexico in that time there was silks and pearls and coral coming in from the pacific from asia but there was also gold and uh porcelain and other stuff coming from the west uh and so you had this mixing of traditions and another example of this is the biome biombo is a mexican variation on the biobu the beobu were these screen partitions that were japanese screen partitions but they were also locations of fabulous art and so mexicans started making those and they made them theirs and so we see how cultures cross and mix and that's one of my favorite things is seeing how all of these cultures come together and so in 2013 i was hired at uvu just by chance i had managed to have three different areas of non-western experience and they were really looking to expand their non-western offerings from zero to one and i got hired here and i'm pleased to say that i actually doubled their non-western offerings from one to two so that's fantastic uh and there isn't a lot of non-western art out there being taught unfortunately it's an area that i didn't go into in graduate school because i didn't have the opportunity not very many people were teaching it so we're really trying to expand people's horizons here and that's what this course is all about so this course is often described as ancient non-western art but what we really mean by that is we mean non-western art that is outside of the western experience that means that it's art from before western interference and colonialism and imperialism so that's different every location you go some of these cultures the polynesian cultures and the african cultures only get dominated by western culture late in the game in the 18th and 19th century so but other places such as the aztecs and the inc of course they're getting conquered in the 16th century so it's a very flexible term but that's what we're looking at i'm not going to go over these course goals they're there in the syllabus or you can pause the screen and look at this if you want but our major goal is not just to give you a review of all the different kinds of art that exist in the world but to give you a sense of that art from its own context to help you to see it how the people who created it saw it this of course fulfills the global and intercultural requirements if you're taking this course for credit at uvu so please look at the syllabus and look that up as well so i hope you understand that right off the bat teaching a course called non-western art is absolutely ridiculous no one actually defines themselves by what they aren't so if you went on a date and you were saying hey you know what do you do for a living and that person said well i'm not a registered nurse you would look at them and wonder what is wrong with them this is the last time i swipe right on tinder we're done uh it's an absurd thing it's an absurd thing to define unique cultures and peoples who think of themselves as uh as shantae on meshika or japanese and to you know wrap them into a category of what they aren't that is that they're non-western it's i'll be honest it's just insulting to it's insulting and condescending that we take all the great art of the world and dump them into one category but we must crawl before we can walk and so most people because they have not had any experience with non-western art we have to start there but i hope you realize how inherently prejudicial and arbitrary the idea of non-western is it immediately puts things into the category of other and so we want to try to avoid that as much as we can and see these cultures as they see themselves even then it's useful to talk about you know these cultures if we're going to define them by the fact that we're not they're not western we ought to have a discussion about what on earth does it mean to be western as it turns out western art is a pretty arbitrary and capricious term as it is so generally when we talk about western art we mean the arts of western civilization and generally that's the arts of the ancient near eastern mediterranean up through the greco-roman period through the classical period and then we shift from the mediterranean up to europe when we get to the periods of say the renaissance the early modern period and of course it expands beyond that because then we get to the early modern period we get to the age of colonialism the age of discovery and imperialism going all the way up to the contemporary period that's a big net to wrap around a lot of material and it's inherently problematic for example things like michelangelo's david and the golden throne of teuton common are separated by more than three thousand years in time and they are separated by over 1500 miles they're two completely different cultures uh the egyptians never would have thought of themselves as any way alike to the catholic italians that created the renaissance and this gets us into the problematic chronology of western art europeans claim artistic traditions that are not necessarily made by europeans like the mask of tutankhamun they also claim things that were not known until the 19th or 20th century things like altamira and the lascaux caves of course were made by people that died out long before the europeans ever arrived in europe and while they're technically european and that they exist in europe they were not made by europeans the same thing is true of stonehenge the people who made stonehenge were replaced by the people who came in and became the first europeans and so how on earth is that ours how do we claim that it's a little bit easier when we look at something like the classical world uh the greeks which dominate the aegean and go on to create the wonders of the parthenon and greek classical sculpture they bring their civilization to the entire eastern mediterranean when alexander the great conquers those regions so maybe we can justify including those areas in western civilization and likewise when the romans come along and conquer that and bring it to northern europe maybe we can make a claim to them both of these cultures are at least european and we're in the areas that you know we consider to be part of the western canon but something very interesting happens in the 7th century we have the muslim expansion and the muslim expansion takes away most of the areas that were once part of the western tradition that is the eastern mediterranean north africa they even go all the way up to spain and spain for 700 years falls under the muslim world and of course they build many great wonderful things like alhambra and elsewhere but even though it's on europe we don't consider them to be europeans even though they lived there for 700 years just to kind of give you a comparison uh america has only been around for about 225 years we certainly think of ourselves as americans um but you know we haven't lived in america well at least unless you're of native american heritage our ancestors haven't lived in america as long as muslims lived in spain and yet somehow we don't consider that to be european it gets even more kind of confusing when you realize there are enormous cross-cultural contacts between islam and the medieval world and the early modern world this is a bellini-style rug it's so named because the famous renaissance painter bellini placed it under the feet of the virgin madonna even though that's a kind of ludicrous thing to do because this is in fact a prayer rug this is a religious artifact and represents a mihrab and an abolution fountain these are things associated with islamic religious practice had bellini known that maybe he wouldn't have done that he included it because it was a fabulous textile the muslims were famous for making textiles and so he included it for that reason and yet we don't consider islamic civilization to be part of the western tradition and that's a shame because the truth is a lot of the things that exist in our world um actually come from the muslim world it's important to know that when the ottoman empire was at its height it controlled large areas of europe and they often you know embraced european traditions this is a portrait of mehmed ii and this is painted by bellini for that reason and yet today you know we only really recognize ottomans for this tufted piece of furniture that we stick our feet up on in the middle of our living room but i hate to break it to you but everything in your living room is in fact uh muslim with the possible exception of the television and the entertainment center uh a couch uh for example uh the word sofa is actually an arabic word and it means a cushion stuffed with wool uh fiber the french word for a couch devon actually comes from a persian word divani which means anti-room and in those anti-rooms people used to sit on cushions on the floor until one day an ottoman got tired of that and said you know this is just tedious let's just lift everything up off the floor on frames and such the couch was invented of course if you're lifting your cushions off the floor you need a place to elevate your feet and that's why the ottoman is called the ottoman but it's not just the ottoman and of course that means the coffee table was also an ottoman and muslim invention and of course it's not so important in the utah valley but other parts of the world coffee was first introduced to the world through the ottoman empire as well so i think this opinions are changing and i think at some point people are going to stop thinking of the western world and start thinking of this interconnected world why did we separate off the eastern mediterranean and sections under muslim control wells because of the strong divisions that existed and the conflicts that existed between the muslim and the christian world but in reality the cultural exchange was enormous so what is western art well generally it's the arts of european heritage and i would even describe that as european identity that is these are the works of art that artists use to identify themselves to describe themselves but it also includes art by non-europeans that was influenced by europeans and art by non-europeans that influenced europeans so even things that weren't made by europeans like say teuton commons throne and etc are lumped into this category because europeans just kind of liked it uh and it also includes areas of domination areas that were dominated by europeans and so anything that appeals to the european sense of aesthetics gets lumped into western art and that's a very fungible and weird category i guess another way to see it is that we're talking about visual culture uh art is the actual physical manifestation of visual culture it's the object and you put in a museum or hang on a wall or or you know you create but visual culture is all of the things that go into that your religion your worldview etc so a better way of talking about this is it's the visual culture of european heritage or european identity how did europeans see themselves and they saw themselves in stylistic terms that is for one they really valued naturalism the naturalism the greeks and the romans the naturalism of the renaissance etc but they also valued monumentality that's really important they like big arts statues cathedrals churches stuff like that a lot of it is also contextual those things that are associated with a classical tradition or that are associated with the tradition of christianity because christianity was the dominant religion for most of the middle ages and the early modern period and then also they see themselves in terms of humanism and progression humanism is a western world view that sees the world as rational one that can be understood one that can be explained one that can be mastered and this leads us to the view that we advance the world we bring in progress wherever we go so if you have that kind of world view how does that impact the way you see non-western art and this is where things get a little bit ugly you see it through the lens of colonialism or imperialism you see non-western art as the other you see it as exotic or romantic or you see it as primitive and that can be both positive and negative in a way and then also it we have to talk about issues of cultural assimilation and appropriation this is perhaps the most important thing we need to kind of dispense with before we can start talking about non-western art is that for most of the last 500 years politically economically the west has dominated the world the west was quite frankly a kind of cultural backwater up until around the 15th or the 16th century it wasn't anything in terms of the scale of the economies of the muslim world or the asian world or china for example but it did have ships and those ships were de-pulled ships that could travel the oceans and so it's a really remarkable thing that in the 17th century by the beginning of the 17th century you know chinese ships muslim ships never went more than about one or two ports beyond their farthest holding they would go to the next neighbor over for trade but not europeans in the 17th century there were european ships in harbors in japan in indonesia in the new world and everywhere else and this is what gave western civilization its global reach we basically in the age of discovery got tired of paying the middle man for all of the things that were coming across the silk road and trade and we went directly to the source and sometimes we went to trade and other times we went to conquer and the legacy of that is with us still today uh we spread all throughout oceania africa and asia and we saw works of art and it changed the world and we brought a lot of that back as plunder but we also brought back ideas and exchanged ideas mexico of course is in fact defined by the conquest we talk about pre-columbian we talk about post-conquest and pre-conquest and this is one of the defining characteristics of mexico to this day is the fact that it is this blend of two cultures spanish and native a word for people who are of mixed heritage is literally mestizo that means mixed but it isn't just there uh as recently as just 70 years ago large chunks of the world of course were still controlled by european powers the british law raj persisted of course until mahatma gandhi and the independence movement in 1947-48 sometimes this colonialism is very very ugly indeed the opium wars a fun little piece of history that you ought to look up a video on long story short what happened is india was the main source of tea excuse me china was the main source of tea for the british empire and the british empire had a mania for tea to the extent that they were basically uh deflating their currency and everything they could do to buy more tea and of course you you can't buy enough tea that way and it ended up causing kind of an economic crisis so they decided well we gotta find something else to trade for tea then silver and gold and whatever we're using and so they had holdings in india and india had opium and with opium they could trade the opium to china for tea and of course what this did is it turned china into a nation of opium addicts and china was very much aware of this and so they shut down the trade they shut down the trade with england and said yeah we'll trade tea for you but we're not going to trade for any more opium because you've strung out our entire nation and england actually went to war with china twice not just once but twice to force them to accept opium so they could stay in tea and so that's why places like hong kong were british protectorates and under the control of england for so long perhaps one of the ugliest episodes is african colonialism the first true genocide of the modern era happened in the belgian congo king leopold ii and the people who followed after him uh instituted a policy of absolute depravity and atrocity against the people of central africa including the dismemberment of hands for minor offenses now while america uh our country didn't have uh vast overseas colonial holdings it did in fact have uh colonial holdings it's important to remember that america was peopled before european powers got to uh hold on to it and of course there was this caused a series of intermittent conflicts with the native peoples including at wounded knee and the subjugation of native americans and for large stretches of american history the policy towards native inhabitants was one of forced americanization native americans were forced into schools where they were forced to wear western clothing and they were forced to cut their hair and not speak their native languages and to speak only english perhaps one of the best summations of this era of colonial and imperialism is found in a poem written by richard kipling richard kipling was one of the great poets of the british empire in the 19th century and he wrote a poem called called the white man's burden the united states and the philippine islands and this poem was oh boy it's just virulently racist there's no other way to describe it it was written on the occasion of a conflict with the united states in a war with the philippines and it was advocating that imperialism was fundamentally a good thing it says take up the white man's burdens send forth the best you breed go bind your sons to exile to serve your captives need to wait in heavy harness unfluttered folk and wild your new caught sullen peoples half devil and half child how insanely racist can you get so the the message was that you know england and america in their colonial holdings were not imperialists and colonialists doing this for their own enrichment and they were doing this for the enrichment of the people that they were conquering and so here you see an emblem of john bull john bull is the british equivalent of uncle sam and in fact uncle sam is also included in this cartoon and on their back they are carrying all the cultures uh that they had conquered and you can see they're carrying them up to civilization well that's a lot of self-serving nonsense uh there were many many things that they did uh and while there were a lot of advances in western practices western science western medicine and western law uh at the same time it was terribly exploitive and so there's this one view of colonialism and imperialism where this was justified to inflict this on all these non-western peoples but then we start to have pushback against this and a very famous scholar by the name of edward saeed who was at columbia university wrote a book called orientalism 1978 and it's one of the principal books of neo-colonialism or repudiation of colonialism the view that the west not just committed atrocities in terms of genocide and conquest but that they committed atrocities against culture and we really owe it to edward saeed for opening up this idea the reason he called it orientalism is that orientalism was a very popular artistic trend that existed in the 19th and early 20th century and when when we say orient usually people today they mean the far orient they mean places like china japan but orientalism in the 19th 18th 19th and 20th century meant anything that was east of the west so that includes things like the eastern mediterranean the muslim worlds as well and they developed this fascination with muslim topics as being exotic in fact the cover of this book is actually taken by a very famous painting by leon jerome one of the most famous french academic painters of the 19th century and it shows the east as exotic luxurious and of course because we're westerners we have a special uh talent for porn we turned this into smut and and you have the otolisk the otolisk is this wonderful monument of well i guess it's wonderful in some ways and awful in others it's a wonderful monument of of western art that we imagine these cultures as sexualized so what these are is these are eroticized females in islamic contexts uh here's a famous one by ange this is another one by mcchetty there were very many famous painters that painted this and so edward saeed's argument was that it you know the colonialism itself conquered peoples subjected them exploited them but by the 1960s most of these colonial holdings have been returned uh and and liberated from the colonial powers and the second half of the 20th century is a massive era of decolonialization of nations uh being granted their own independence and but he said that there still was a kind of colonialism taking place this is a colonialism of thought of culture and i think one of the best examples of this is the concept the islamic concept of harem so if i said the word harem to you if you are a person who is you know doesn't have a particular interest in this or don't have any particular knowledge in this even if you just went and googled the word harem and i don't advise you do this unless you know what you're getting into uh a harem in modern concept even today means a collection of sexually available women usually in islamic setting but not always and that's what a harem is harem was this you know kind of sexual uh erotic place where you had women it was imagined that the sultan of the ottoman empire had these vast palaces full of nubile young women to satisfy his lusts and it became this great erotic image and in fact there are many images of western art that depict harems etc well i hate to break it to you but that's almost all exclusively fantasy it's not true it never ever was true harem in the islamic context just means the domestic parts of the house and so when you were going to the palace when you left the palace where you know the main function of the government was and you went into the harem you're going into the private domestic parts the house so yes uh he would have had multiple wives and concubines but if you had gone into any of these harems instead of finding a bath house full of naked beauties like this uh you would instead would have found a family scene you would have seen kids mothers mother-in-laws you know snot-nosed kids pulling on their mother's uh you know clothing and in the islamic context it represented family and in fact when you see artistic depictions of it such as in this miniature from a moogle artist this is a harem and instead you see older women younger women they're all fully dressed uh you know you see the father kissing the child you see a very very different scene so this is exactly what edward syed meant by orientalism that there in addition to the kind of literal colonialism there's kind of a mental or a culture colonialism we take other cultures and we manipulate them to suit our needs and this creates misinterpretations and misconceptions about cultures you know harem is you know a sexual fantasy in the west whereas it's not necessarily that's its original intent and here i'm going to show you something that hopefully will be revealing again as i mentioned uh if you're listening into this on youtube and you're not one of my students i teach at utah valley university and utah valley university is in of course uh in orem utah uh utah is a place known for a certain religious minority uh called the church of jesus christ of latter-day saints more commonly known as the mormons and so speaking to my predominantly mormon audience out there of students uh this actually is something that happened to mormons this is a mormon maid this was a movie that was made in 1917 and it tells the story of a young girl who is captured by the evil and vile mormons and forced into sexual slavery to be part of their harems uh now of course if you're a mormon this is absolutely ridiculous i mean i'm a mormon and i've been a mormon my whole life and you know i've never seen those eye robes at beehive clothing gosh where do you get those maybe they're in the back so you know i mean it's it's absurd it's a complete fantasy it doesn't isn't really based in kind of truth in any way and yet mormons were often because they were this very strange unique religious minority in the far west uh that they were depicted as being you know this bizarre uh group of people that abducted women and forced them into sexual slavery one of my favorite stories about this is that they often referred to mormondom as the harems of the west because mormons at the time did practice polygamy of course mark twain went there and he had his opinions about it and said yeah it doesn't look like it's all that sexy my favorite story is that richard burton the famous english explorer made a trip to utah specifically to go see if there was any truth to these salacious uh you know sexual stories being told about mormons he had a great fascination for erotica in fact he collected massive volumes on it and wrote a lot on it and his wife had it all burned when he died she was so embarrassed by it what a loss uh but he came to utah and quickly discovered that now we're we're really much more boring than anyone ever imagined and so he uh you know gave up and went up american fork canyon and uh had a drinking contest with porter rockwell true story uh fun stuff but you can still see this if you've ever if you're a fan of sherlock holmes if you're a fan of sherlock holmes a study in scarlet one of the first sherlock holmes book the villains are mormons they are mormons there to abduct virginal english women off the street of england so i like to include this because when i'm speaking to my students they don't realize that they too were the victims of othering they too were the victims of being you know othered in that way and so we should very carefully re-examine what we think about other cultures you know good gravy if they can turn mormons into uh you know sexy villains than you know i can do it to anybody because seriously we're just as boring as can be anyhow moving on that being said uh i do want to offer a word of caution well i think that what edward syed did was very valuable and actually gave us a way of deconstructing so many layers of stuff that had accreted around the study of non-western cultures we do have to be careful because in some way a colonialism this view of the edward saeed orientalism is the flip side of the coin of the reuter kipling view uh and that sounds bizarre but let me explain it this way western civilization is content is often wants to play itself as the hero it also is content however to be the villain and there's a very interesting thing about that you know in one view in the view under colonialism these poor benighted non-western peoples needed the guidance and assistance of western civilization in under the view of orientalism by edward saeed uh these poor um you know non-western cultures were exploited and distorted by western civilization what do those two views have in common what they have in common is that the focus is on western civilization i want you to think about that very clearly in one western civilization is the hero and in the other western civilization is the villain but they are essentially western focuses western um viewpoints and that actually kind of makes sense because edward syed even though he was of a palestinian extraction taught at columbia university he himself was a marxist in his philosophy was an avowed marxist and karl marx was german and was a western philosopher so we have to be careful that we don't you know it's very important to correct misconceptions but too often we correct misconceptions and immediately go into talking about the west did wrong and we don't give these people their own voice and here's something i want you to listen to very very carefully and i want you to repeat it and i'll repeat it here for most of the history of humans on this planet western civilization wasn't the bad guy wasn't the good guy it was simply and purely irrelevant say that again for most of the history of human civilization western civilization was irrelevant for most of islamic civilization most of chinese civilization europe was the strange place on the far frontier that they hardly ever thought of and if anybody ever went there they went there and they reported yeah it's not that great economically it wasn't as big and it just wasn't that significant so it's just kind of an accident of history that the west became so powerful in the last 500 years and came to dominate but if we only look at these cultures in terms of that period of western domination then we do a great disservice to these cultures you know we're still talking about western civilization instead of letting them speak with their own voices so for most of this class when it's relevant when a western worldview comes in and you know destroys a native worldview yeah we'll comment on that but for most of this class imperialism and colonialism is simply going to be treated as irrelevant we're going to try to talk about these cultures and how they thought of themselves before one of my favorite stories is the story of ibn batuta ibn batuta was this great um muslim explorer and scholar who came out of north africa and he went on hajj went to the holy land with the muslim holy land mecca and he went there and then he on a series of misadventures eventually wound up traveling all the way to china and then he came back and his emir said you've got to go down to west africa because there's this great civilization called mali down there you've got to go visit them and and because you're the only person that has traveled the whole world and he said well what about europe i haven't been to europe and then they both had a good laugh and forgot about it because nobody cared about europe you know west africa and mali was more significant in the minds of muslim civilization at the time of ibn patuta than western civilization was so for most of its history western civilization was irrelevant now some of the other issues complicated issues we've got to get into are cultural appropriation cultural appropriation is something that we talk a great deal about and unfortunately it gets very very heated and very acrimonious i want to bring this one up this one is a wonderful example of that so the movie moana came out uh great film and of course because it's a disney movie uh girls want to dress up like disney princesses and moana is one of the disney princesses and so they made costumes that of moana so that you could for halloween and on your disney vacation dress up like moana and they showed a picture of a girl who appears white of european extraction at least she appears european extraction dressed like moana and this caused an enormous ruckus because they said that a white person dressing like moana is in fact a form of cultural appropriation and it got very very heated now for me i found this very perplexing because well let me just let me just be blunt like this moana is a movie by disney one of the largest companies in the world one of the largest western entertainment companies in the world it is an animated film animated films are a western art form uh it is a musical which again is another western art form and most of it is in english which is a western language there are a few native that they do use some samoan in there and the music is written by uh a guy who's puerto rican in extraction so it seems funny to me that um this costume is where we're going to draw the line on cultural appropriation the entire movie uh becomes problematic uh it the entire movie is an exercise in cultural appropriation and so if we're gonna if we're gonna stop if we're gonna you know clutch the pearls at this little girls costume for little girls it seems to me that we need to back the bus up a little bit and say well should we be making a movie like this at all should we be having these kind of conversations discussions at all and that's something we need to talk about uh you know is the movie itself a valid thing to do one of the things i want to point out is that cultural assimilation and appropriation is itself a major avenue of culture first you cannot stop it and second it creates some really amazing and beautiful things the irises that are so famous by van gogh are directly inspired by irises on byobo screens painted by japanese there's no doubt about this japanese art had a profound impact on western art that is cultural assimilation it is cultural appropriation we also have to understand that cultures for their own reasons appropriate things up until about 150 years ago fashion in japan was still predominantly native traditional fashion but then because of events relating to commodore perry and the trade war that they fight with america japan uh experiences rapid western westernization japan was mostly shut off it traded with the dutch and the portuguese and they wouldn't do direct trading with anybody else and we of course wanted to do direct trade with japan so what did we do we sent commodore perry with our warships and we bombed tokyo harbor yay what a great way to open trade negotiations now the japanese had cannons they had guns and they weren't terribly afraid of americans but they didn't realize how fast industrial processes had advanced and how how much western cannons had improved so we could shoot uh their harbor successfully from the ocean and their cannons couldn't even reach our ships this caused a little bit of a panic in japanese civilization and japanese civilization decided we need to industrialize we need to westernize quickly or else we'll be overrun by these western barbarians and so you can see here the beginnings of western fashion moving in but this was largely a matter of japanese appropriation even before world war ii uh japanese had appropriated mostly western dress and continued to adapt to all kinds of western fashions and so cultures themselves are agents of change we can't look at this in cultural appropriation and say well there's a good guy or a bad guy because cultures themselves appropriate change and adapt from western society or elsewhere and some things that we take for granted as being native are not for example west africa is very famous for wax resist fabrics but that tradition was actually introduced to west africa by dutch traders from indonesia so you can't get around cultural appropriation it's impossible cultural appropriation in many ways is one of the main agents of cultures in the world and so much of what we take for granted as being native to one culture to the other actually had its origins in another culture the distinction i guess then would be is the intent and the focus and the context you always have to look at context in terms of cultural appropriation something like these orientalist paintings that sexualize something that was not intended to be sexualized yeah that does real damage to a culture and that's a negative form of cultural appropriation but not all forms of cultural appropriation or assimilation are negative and not only that even if we wanted to we couldn't sort out all the different threads of how these things come together another major issue that we have to kind of hammer down into is primitivism primitivism is a viewpoint that comes out of western civilization that western civilization looked at other cultures as being primitive as being less sophisticated culturally etc but it's interesting that primitivism manifests itself in different ways for example when african art first started appearing in western markets it had a profound impact on western artists western artists saw it as more natural more authentic more spiritual and so you have picasso assimilating african masks he actually went to the trocadero palace where there was a massive exhibition of native and african arts in 1906 and that was probably what sparked off his you know invention of cubism uh so it's really remarkable primitivism can of course have some very negative consequences these are collections of heads that were found in nigeria and they were found by british archaeologists in the 1930s when they were discovered the assumptions were that africans were incapable of making such beautiful and sophisticated bronzes bronzes that had such subtle naturalism and even idealism these things very much appealed to western senses of aesthetics but because their assumptions about african art were that they could only make abstract and stylized art they denied that these could possibly be african and for many years they went to great lengths to suggest that well you know maybe there was a traveling portuguese sculptor who or a monk who landed in africa and he's the one that sculpted these it's really offensive and insulting uh of course eventually people realized no that these were native works of african art um and that they they did belong to the african tradition so sometimes primitivism just makes us act like bigots and makes us deny the value or the incapacity of of native cultures but there's also the opposite effect that is we can romanticize primitivism even positive but over romanticized views of of cultures can damage the idea of non-western cultures for example paul gauguin was really into this idea of the spiritual primitive he liked the idea of the spiritual primitive so he went to great lengths to find spiritual primitives and he went to tahiti and he painted these lush paintings with tahitian natives and to them they were more spiritual and authentic but that can be very condescending and patronizing and we see this show up in art all the time for example in movies such as the movie pocahontas pocahontas is almost treated like this goddess of nature uh and you know as this source of of wisdom and that's really kind of an infertilization of non-western cultures you know the truth is non-western cultures uh they have bad aspects and positive aspects they are fully formed cultures in their own right they do things for their own reasons they're not here just to be our spiritual guides or to fulfill our fantasies so this is kind of the flip side of orientalism you know we can turn anything into smut but we can also turn anything into a kind of trope or a stereotype in a way this is a kind of extension of what spike lee called the magic negro phenomenon that there are an awful lot of movies such as the green mile where there are main characters who are african-american uh but they exist only to serve the spiritual needs of white characters in those movies and so we have to be very careful we look at these non-western cultures that we look at them from a perspective that is more native to that culture that doesn't just see them as you know kind of fulfilling our wishes or wants so what are some non-western points of view well there's too many to talk about here but just to give you a taste of it i want to give you a taste of some of the things that we'll be talking about let's take a look for example of this this is the lakshmana temple this is a 10th century temple in kajurahu as part of the kasharahu group of temples this is this highest level of of kind of artistic expression in the high medieval era in india and while the statues are noted for these beautiful sculptures they are also noted for a great deal of erotic sculptures and when these were first rediscovered in during the british raj even other hindus didn't quite understand them in fact gandhi wanted them all kind of dynamited or blown up because he thought they were offensive it's kind of amazing but we look at these and of course we think of these and of course we misinterpret these constantly and again we misinterpret it in both directions at first it was this feeling that well wow hindu civilization must have just been uh you know overly sexualized and and lurid and that's not true and then of course then the 60s came along when everything was groovy a lot of people went to india a lot of people read the kama sutra and started uh you know interpreting these in other ways and of course those were you know overreactions as well in truth most of these representations have to do with the idea of intimacy of spiritual intimacy what better way to describe the intimacy between the god and the utterant than through sexual intimacy and if you think that's really all that unusual then think about christian analogies and metaphors jesus christ is always referring to himself as the bridegroom well what does a bridegroom and the bride do they consummate the marriage it is an intimate union that is being described so it's really not all that foreign but we need to see that you know something that we would see as either scandalous or perhaps overly sexualized is not necessarily the case another example is how they view identity these are two pictures that are roughly contemporaneous it's amazing so one we have a ming emperor and the other we have charles v who was the emperor of the holy roman empire and also king of spain so two very very powerful rulers but two very very different images in one image there is intentional stylization again in china the emperor is more than just a very powerful individual like charles v charles v wanted an image that looked like him he wanted to be identified but like this is not nearly so important in the chinese tradition what was more important is his role in society and so you see that ming emperors are often almost depicted mountain-like as if they are immovable because they represent this kind of linchpin in society and in the cosmos one of the other things that would differ is just sometimes subject matter in the west landscape is not regarded as a very important um you know subject matter not until the 19th century does landscape become this fully formed art form in its own sake but in china landscape was always important and a lot of this had to do with views of religion taoism etc uh there was these you know kind of rules to art that you know to show a human being larger in scale in an environment was somehow arrogant that you wanted to show nature at its correct scale so the figures the fishermen across the shores are very very small and the landscape itself becomes a major source of representation so landscape is going to figure very importantly going all the way back to the 6th and 7th century in china whereas it's going to take the 19th century before the west comes around here's another example calligraphy calligraphy is the highest art form in the islamic world bar none it makes sense that a culture that so honors the word of god in the quran would elevate words themselves calligraphy to the highest level of art what you're looking at here is a safavidfolio this is a scrapbook so this is all his this is a prince's uh collection of all his favorite epigrams or or writings by calligraphers and he got them to write them in some are actually literally cut and pasted in some are signed in the book and it's a really amazing art style and this is an art style for connoisseurs and it still remains that way uh modern calligraphy in iran is is still very very powerful but of course this is very different than the west you know things like book arts calligraphy uh typography those are regarded as minor arts or decorative arts in the west so if you're a civilization that has a different view of what's valuable you're going to have a different kind of art and so art like this didn't meet the western definition it's small it's in a book you know it wasn't monumental it wasn't a 20-foot wide painting or a 10-foot high statue or a great cathedral but yet this was what was valued by their civilization and so we have these conflicts that exist or erupt because of that really different views of what is important in society so i think it's time to to get into just a brief overview of well if we're talking about non-western art what are we talking about what is non-western art well western art is generally the areas that you're going to see here areas covered by europe and the major colonies of europe and that's what we mean by you know western art so western art is going to be centered in other areas and so we're going to talk about the worlds of islam which is includes north africa and the middle east and into central asia we're going to talk about sub-saharan africa we're going to talk about latin america which includes south america but also mesoamerica and we're going to talk about pre-columbian cultures as well we're also going to talk about the native american cultures and cultures of would be the native american indian and the caribbean we're also going to talk about far east asia south east asia and also the indigenous cultures of the polynesian islands and australia what we call collectively oceania so let's talk about what some of these are so when we talk about pre-columbian art we're talking about latin american art from the time before the arrival of columbus before the arrival of the west and we have lots of amazing cultures here we have the andean cultures of peru chile bolivia amazon basin we also have the archaeology of colombia in mesoamerican art we have central america guatemala mexico this would be the olmecs the mayan the aztecs the andean culture is going to be things like the moche the inca etc so this is a this is the staff god this comes from te wanaku which is in modern day bolivia this is a very famous olmec head this is the great portal to wanoku in the andean zone this is one of these wonderful masks the sikon ceremonial masks but of course it also includes the massive engineering of machu picchu and other incan locations when we get to mesoamerica we're going to be talking about the olmec but of course also the maya and their incredible sculptures and temples but we're also going to be talking about the aztec which is what we call a post-classic civilization or a terminal classic civilization civilization right before the conquest with their great wonderful style love the aztecs when we talk about amerindian and caribbean art we're going to be talking about north america mound builders pueblo plains woodland pacific northwest all of those places there's huge archaeological sites all over the eastern half of the united states this is cahokia and modern-day illinois there were huge civilizations in north america once a top upon a time including you know quilt cliff dwellers and pueblos as well when we talk about southeast asian art we'll be talking about vedic mauryan hindu and khmer cultures of course this includes the earliest indus river valley civilizations which were the foundations but it also includes stupa at sanchi the great colossal buddhas in bamiyan but also rock cut temples at ashanta with their fabulous paintings as well as the high medieval period and these beautiful chola bronzes as well as some of the great monuments of southeast asia like boropidor when we get to asian art we're talking of course about chinese art han ming iro etc as well and includes everything from the terracotta water warriors up to tang and song painting the forbidden city but also korean art uh sela dynasty and of course the great works of of the ido period uh wonderful works such as hokusai's a series of paintings on mount fuji a series of prints on mount fuji then we'll also talk about islamic art which includes arts of north africa egypt arab nations the umayyads the abbasids the fatimids the mamluks the ottomans but also includes non-arabic cultures including persia india central asia the taj mahal is probably the most famous building in india yet it's an islamic monument so we'll look at things like the great mosque at cordoba the alhambra in spain we'll look at book arts including beautiful examples like this the quran of babar is the second but also wonderful things like south event manuscripts then we'll look at sub-saharan africa which includes wonderful things such as these beautiful heads of the oni from ife uh benin plaques and benin empire but also really unique traditions africa such diverse continent many many different cultures and then finally uh we'll take a look at australia and oceana uh australia oceana polynesia we'll look at maori carvings and easter island heads all of these wonderful you know examples of monumental engineering but also x-ray style paintings in australia and elsewhere some important points to consider for this class is that this course is a history course there's a lot of concepts terminology and vocabulary a lot of dates and there's also a lot to talk about historical methodology and there's also a lot about social religious and political context dates periods movements cultures for example the the conquest is a very important historical event so you need to know about it you also need to know about timelines calendars chronologies etc some cultures we know right down to the date others we only describe by dynasty et cetera for example in china we largely talk about dynasties these are ruling families or clans and so we'll talk about han tang song ming etc we also have to know cultural terms like hajj and nirvana so things like the conquest for example pretty much determine the breaking point between pre-columbian and latin american art if you're going to understand islamic art you have to understand islamic belief you have to understand what the kaaba shrine is and what the hajj is all about if you're going to understand buddhist art you have to understand the buddha including terms like samsura nirvana karma all of these things come out of the vedic tradition this is a very famous gandaran relief and this one is the mahapira or nirvana or the death of the buddha this is where the buddha goes on to nirvana so what is nirvana and why is it different than going to heaven or hell it's completely different concept so we spend a lot of time talking about religion culture history and you really have to be on top of those so that's the class in a nutshell but i'm just going to briefly go through some of the mechanics of the class on this part of the lecture all of this is found online on the canvas site so you can double check it there but let me give you the highlights first off this class does have a required textbook but the textbook is integrated into the class which means you don't have to pay for it because you've already paid for it it's right in your student fees so if you go to canvas and go onto the webpage you should see this integrated textbook it's in a course module just below the course introduction and it will have links and i also have a course schedule that will give you the readings for each course module and you should be able to go to that link in that course module and go directly to the reading uh the latest uh version even though this has vermeer on the cover uh which is kind of insulting and we're here on western class uh it does have quite extensive readings on non-western art which is yay finally we have something about non-western art the course requirements are pretty straightforward there's two exams a midterm and a final the final is non-comprehensive and in terms of assignments we have a paper or a project and yet comes with an annotated bibliography that you have to produce as a proposal and that's 40 of your grade and then finally you have class citizenship and participation so and we'll talk about all of those so let's talk about the exams the exams are pretty straightforward they are going to be on canvas they are going to be proctored through a third party service known as proctorio which sounds like the worst superhero origin story ever and they are essentially open book and open note but they're not open internet and open friends sorry no lifelines you can't call somebody uh they're essay-based so there you don't have to know dates and facts for the test but it's better if you know them so what i'm going to do is i'm going to give you five short essays two comparison contrast essays and three unknowns and right here is a sample exam to give you a sense of what that looks like so for the five short essays what i'll do is i'll show you an image and i'll ask you a short question about it so i'll show you an image like this and the question will be something like this just give me two examples for one examples and in 25 to 50 words can you respond and answer that there'll be five of those then there's comparison and contrast essay questions in this case i'll show you two images and then you'll have to answer a much longer question those are a little bit more involved and it'll take a little bit more time again it's open book it's open note but if you don't know this the test is timed it takes about an hour to take and you have two hours to take it you won't have time to just search through the internet and search through everything so you really have to know it in advance so there's two comparison contrast essay questions and then finally there's the unknowns in the unknowns i will show you an image that you haven't seen in class but it should look familiar to something on the study list and you should be able to compare it to something off the study list and give me the complete information off the study list and explain what are the characteristics that allow you to make that comparison the other thing is the research paper or project now for this class you can do either a paper or a project you don't have to do both let's talk about research papers first research papers are essentially a term paper you have to pick a topic covered by the class and what you want is to pick a topic narrow enough that you can say something meaningful about it don't pick something too broad like pre-columbian art or even mayan art is too broad instead focus down on something narrow like say to call the temple want it to call or the program of sichuan cowell at to call or for example or pick something like you know a particular tang painter if you're into landscape painting don't pick something too broad it has to be a topic of non-western art and you have to submit a proposal for your topic you can choose your own topic but you have to submit a proposal and the proposal has to come with at least five academic sources and that means not your textbook not wikipedia not in encyclopedia britannica but academic sources and resources i have guidelines for this on canvas if you look the guidelines there are resources that will take you to the fulton library that's the uvu library where you can get help or you can find a research guide that will help you find academic scholarly journals and books yes the library is open you can still come into the library but there's a lot of resources that you can find online the proposal will let me know you're on the right track that you have a correct topic proposals are due and they're coming up pretty quick in a month and that is on the course schedule so make sure you know when those deadlines are so research papers i'm looking for clear and concise composition but they also have to be formatted correctly this is art history you must use the chicago manual of style you must use footnotes and bibliography if you're familiar with mla or apa or parenthetical citation those are not allowed in art history again i don't make the rules i'm teaching a discipline and part of my job is to make you teach the discipline and i had to suffer through it so i'm perpetuating the cycle of abuse no no no that's not what i'm doing i am not perpetuating the cycle of abuse there's a lot of different disciplines out there and part of taking a class and this is getting experience in different disciplines and different writing so if you are not familiar with if you are not familiar with the chicago manual of style get familiar now i have resources in the guidelines they can help you now that's one option you can just take a straight research paper and if you're an art history major a liberal arts major humanities major that's the direction you should go because that's what your job is going to be more like is doing research but if you're a studio student i do allow creative research projects and this student here made a wonderful project she gave me a stick that i could beat people with if they didn't do it chicago manual of style no that's not correct what she did is she actually made a mock wheedle machuido is this obsidian lined club that was used by the aztecs lethal thing and she actually flipnapped all the obsidian herself incredible stuff uh and so that's an example of a kind of project now i want to point out that there's lots of different projects you can do you can do a scale model a reproduction of historical work a demonstration of a technique this is a scale model of the castillo at chichen itza it's really done very well but you could do something like a reproduction of an artistic object like a chalk mule this is a sacrificial altar from the toltec in the aztec period here's a reproduction of a zuni vase but if you'd prefer you could do something technique based like i had a student that wanted to do something with japanese wood block prints or with japanese painting here's an example where a student actually made their own loom and wove a little tiny weft-faced navajo blanket beautiful to the touch oh my gosh it was so luxurious okay so you can replicate a technique or make a historical reproduction or you can do an original work of art like this student they did it on acetate but this was authentic to designs from the pacific northwest and of course it was an original work of art but it showed that they were being very sensitive to the original material this one's quite imaginative this is a kippu now kippu are usually made out of wool they're made out of llama fiber and they're a method of record keeping amongst the inka and the quechua but she decided to make this a necklace but the necklace has is made out of gold wire but it has beads but like a kipu the beads and the location of the beads indicate dates and numbers and so each one of these gold wires uh actually contains a set of beads that records an important date in the life of her children which was really cool so even though this was not i mean no inca ever made a kipu out of gold and turquoise didn't ever happen they made him out of textiles but even though she made it out of a different material it showed she was sensitive to the original intent of recording significant dates and information she was a jewelry student and so that was something that she worked for her strengths so you can do an original work of art but it has to show how you are being sensitive to the original culture i really want people to understand that these are research projects they're not graded on artistic merit or originality i have students that do beautiful projects and i go wow that's beautiful f because it's obvious that they were just working to their own stereotype pastiche view of these cultures and not giving me something that was authentic and proved their research they're not graded on artistic merit people they are graded on how well they demonstrate your research into that culture can you in a sensitive way take their culture and give me a work of art that shows me that you really learned something about the culture that's what's important and of course there are also full guidelines for the projects on canvas make sure you look at them everything we're doing is online people so everything's got to be submitted through canvas that means it's got to be submitted in electronic format that means it's got to be submitted as a word doc or a pdf don't send me google documents or links to google documents i can't use those if your project requires to do is like a video element then embed that link into your pdf document and upload it when you finish with your project you will have to submit a self evaluation one to two pages describing what you learned about this culture and that's the place you're going to put your documentation you have to document your project how you made it your process and also your final images and if you need a link to a video or something you can host that on the other side and put that link in that embedded document okay uh i don't accept late papers for any reason unless it's very serious if you have if genuine illness a genuine family emergency contact me immediately i'm not an ogre i'm not a horrible person but this is real life there's none of this you know it's five days late i'll mark it 20 off no there's a deadline you know what the deadline is if the deadline conflicts with anything get it done early and get it in early nothing prevents you from doing it early so make sure you get it in and if you have a catastrophe there's going to have to be some kind of documentation if you're sick a doctor's note something like that this is college this is real life this isn't high school where you have a limit endless hangout of deadlines or dates i shouldn't have to talk about academic honesty but of course plagiarism and cheating is not allowed take a look at the student handbook for more and also read the syllabus finally class citizenship and participation there's no face-to-face meetings in this class the class is mostly asynchronous which means that as the lectures get posted you can watch them at your own leisure but there are weekly discussions and you must comment on the weekly discussions so don't let those go too far don't let it go some people let it go to the end of the class and try to watch all the lectures before the midterm or for the final that won't work read the assignments watch the videos participate in the discussions stay on top of it you'll do fine if you're not familiar with canvas you really should be familiar with canvas the review and study sheets are already online the discussions are there a lot of this information is there for you so if you're really stuck just jump into it and get it and if you need to contact me send me a message i'm very good about responding to messages if it's over the weekend it may be the monday before i respond to you but i generally respond within 24 hours business days of of your message i'm really excited about this class this is the first time i've taught this class online i'm certain there's going to be a lot of hiccups if you run into any problems just let me know i'm here for you i want everyone to succeed i want everyone to love these cultures as much as i do i will see you in the next later lecture till then ciao
