good morning all right really quick let's get started everybody so there's been a change to the midterm I went ahead I went ahead and scheduled the midterm for the week before Thanksgiving this will ensure that everyone has a chance to do their holiday travels and we can get everything graded in a timely manner I want everybody to pull out a sheet of paper actually multiple sheets of paper I will post these lecture slides but not until after the lecture because I want everybody to be engaged in drawing out these figures that we're going to be doing this is a very very geometrical uh lesson it's going to require a lot of spatial thinking and if you're following along with a with a um something on your iPad it's just not going to work it's going to be better if you're drawing this out obviously a tablet if you're drawing it out on a tablet that's great too so we talked about the forces on a Charged particle or a collection of charged particles due to a magnetic field but we didn't worry about how the field got there to begin with what we're going to do today is we're going to actually find how we get that magnetic field so here we have a picture of CERN the LHC the LHC uses magnetic fields in a bunch of different ways they use magnetic fields to control the location of the proton to prevent the proton from colliding in with the walls as it goes around in the cyclotron and they also use magnetic fields to inject energy into the system by pulsing it and they they're able to accelerate the protons using magnetic fields so magnetic fields are very important they have a ton of applications okay question yes okay better okay thanks for reminding me about that okay so now we're going to look at where the magnetic field comes from so here we have our first image of a Charged particle positive charged particle moving with some velocity in this direction and you can see there's a hand there pointing along the velocity path and then there's a little r hat Vector in the center there and that's very important as well and there's also a field Point p and then there's a magnetic field encircling this charge the the simplest concept I want you to get from this picture so far to start with is when we have a positive charge going this way if I take my right hand and I point it in the direction of the Velocity that the charge is moving in there will be a magnetic field due to that and the direction of the magnetic field is going to be the curl of my fingers so as you can see there the magnetic field B is curling around this charge as it goes so stated clearly the right hand rule for the magnetic field due to a positive charge moving at constant velocity you take the the thumb of your right hand in the direction of the velocity and then your fingers now curl around the charge in the direction of the magnetic field lines and if the charge is negative the field lines move in the opposite direction and then we have these field points r and v they both lie in that beige plane and then B is perpendicular to this plane then for these field points which I'll talk about more in a second these field points r and v both lie in the gold plane and then B is perpendicular to this plane as well so you can see there's two separate planes in this figure and then we have a perspective view on top where the X symbol indicates the charges moving into the plane of the page and you can do that right now you can take your hand point it into the page and you'll see that your fingers give you the correct direction for the magnetic field and then we get this equation for the quantity uh the magnetic field uh magnitude of the magnetic field so no longer the vector form of it and it's given by this expression but I'm going to show you exactly how we arrive at that just one more view of this perspective View and then the magnetic field vectors due to a moving positive charge at each point B it's perpendicular to that plane like I said earlier of r and v and its magnitude is proportional to the sign of the angle between them so let's draw that out specifically so we can see what we're talking about here stated the way that the book has it it's written like that that's a symbolic way to represent it but there's other ways to write this out that I think are a little bit better okay so now I'm going to do it uh my way the style that I've like to to do it because I think it's more common sense okay so we have our positive charge U it's moving at some velocity B can everybody see that clearly great then we have our Field Point R hat technically you could write this sorry I don't have a ruler let me try to make that a little bit a little bit more straight if we could call this a field Point P like they do in the book but you'll also see it just written as R hat what R hat is is it's a position Vector it points from the point of wherever the charge is to wherever we're worried about the magnetic field you see this is a much more complicated situation than just one equation this actually represents an infinite number of equations for every single situation you could possibly imagine because I don't just have one Field Point here I have an infinite number of field points in this entire figure and the magnetic field is going to depend upon what that field point is for example if I choose a point along here as my field Point P I'm going to get a z zero magnetic field and I'll show you why so first of all we have our R which is our Vector our R hat but then if we want to actually put this in a form that we can use to calculate an actual magnitude we have to figure out how to work with this expression so we have in the the most formal terms the magnetic Vector magnetic field is this const called the permeability of free space it's the ability of a space to support a magnetic field it's different for different substances in un L otherwise specified since we're not doing magnetic materials we'll always assume it's the permeability of free space but just know that different surfaces and different environments will have a different permeability associated with them but muot is that which is true for free space the ability of free space essentially what we would think of as a vacuum to support a magnetic field and then we have this constant 4 Pi on the bottom that's the constant part then we have q our charge V our Vector cross our hat and then I put a magnitude R cubed on bottom which one of those will cancel out as you'll see in a second so now what we want to do is we want to put this in a form where we have a magnitude so we want to actually write now B magnitude so I'm going from a vector to a magnitude mu over 4 Pi so far so good this is just a scalar we don't have to do anything to it now we have a cross product what do we do with a cross product what's the way to write it there's a way that we can write it what we want is we want the r Vector portion of R here this R Vector this is our magnitude we want the portion of the r Vector that's perpendicular to this velocity component let me put a Theta here too we need that okay so that's this Vector so we have r s Theta so we're going to have q v R sin of theta and then we have that over R cubed but then one of these RS cancels out so then we have mu over 4 Pi QV sin Theta over R 2 and and that gives us our magnitude of our B field okay does anybody have any questions yes this this is the actual vector B and this is the magnitude V the velocity so we when we take this when we take this angle between V and R then we just then we don't have to worry about the direction of V anymore we take the we take the portion of R that's perpendicular to V and that's that then we don't have to do any no further no further analysis required for the vector but you can keep the little arrow over it if you want just to know that it still is the velocity yes question I'm sorry I didn't hear you um you could think of it as the magnitude essentially but it's it is it's we can do that too that's fine because once you take the once you look once you take this this cross product you're looking at the component perpendicular to it but the book has it written with the arrow still over it so you can use either convention actually the book doesn't have it written with the arrow over it sorry so okay great so yes just to clarify then but you can't but I have seen it written where they keep the arrow over it so the point is when the notation you have to just know what exactly you're doing because you'll see the the notation will vary from place to place but yes once you take that that cross product and you find the component perpendicular that's that's all the geometrical information that you need then at that point now we're at now we're just down to a magnitude for that so the quantity mu is called It's called The Magnetic constant and um it's also called the permeability of free space and a point charge in motion also produces an electric field with field lines that radiate outward from positive charge the magnetic field lines are completely different for a point charge moving with velocity V the magnetic field lines are circles centered on the line of v and lying in Planes perpendicular to this line the field line directions for a positive charge are given by the right hand rule and what you do is you grasp the velocity Vector with your right hand so that your right thumb points in the direction of v and then your fingers curl around the line of v in the same sense as the magnetic field lines assuming that Q is positive if it's negative which direction does it go and then opposite correct okay so we have this figure that we've seen a couple times already I want you to draw that out and visualize it as we go forward and do these examples so this figure shows parts of a few of these field lines but just know that there's an infinite number of them because we're actually dealing with a vector field and then some of the field lines are in a plane through Q perpendicular to V and then what about these what's B for field points R hats position vectors that go through here what's my B going to be what's it going to be equal to anybody and why is that why is it going to be equal to zero yes exactly because we we're looking at the component perpendicular not the component that's parallel in this direction so the B field going through this point is zero and you can see that in this drawing as well okay so these equations describe the B field of a point charge moving with constant velocity if the charge accelerates the field can be much more complicated and we won't need these more complicated results what actually happens if it accelerates is it emits radiation and that process is very complicated it actually requires in some cases Quantum field Theory and in other cases we can treat it classically in this in this class especially at this moment we won't worry about it at all eventually we will talk about the beautiful unification between electric and magnetic fields that are encapsulated in Maxwell's equations but we're not there yet first we need to get all of the basics down so we're just going to note that we're talking about charges moving at constant velocities when we look at these situations so the moving charge particles that make up a current in a wire accelerate at points where the wire bends and the direction V changes because the magnitude VD of the drift velocity in in a conductor is typically very small the centripetal acceleration VD ^2 R remember that from your classical mechanics cental acceleration v^2 r that is so small that we can ignore its effects so what they're saying here is actually there's acceleration even in a normal wire when it curves around because a change in direction is also an acceleration but the component of that velocity is small enough that we can just ignore it and not worry about it when we're doing our analysis so that's why you'll see later on we're doing it for a straight current carrying conductor a straight section of it so that's a question that I'm a subtle point that some of you might be wondering about if you're thinking about this that's a good way to illustrate why the limits of our analysis for this situation but this is how we do it we always take the simplest case and we break everything down into pieces and then we can treat the more complicated situations later so in SI units the numerical value of m not has been measured to 9 significant figures which is a huge scientific accomplishment in its own right and it's this value and it can be expressed in different units uh the common form to see it in is Tesla meters per ampere 4 Pi * 10us 7 but you will see it in other uh forms from time to time um and then there's another amazing aspect of this magnetic constant um recall that we have an electric constant called the the permitivity of free space that's the ability of free space to support an electric field not a magnetic field an electric field that's Epsilon knot uh and that appears in kul's law and gauss's law and it has this value of 8.854 * 10-2 Kum s per Newton * me squar we can multiply epsilon0 by mu0 so we can multiply the two values together and then we can take the square root of the product and then the reciprocal of the result and we get the speed of light so what that tells you is that there's a link between these electric and magnetic fields and the ability of free space to support them when you combine that you have an electric and magnetic field moving through space at the speed of light which would lead scientists to specul maybe an a changing electric and magnetic field in the right way is light which is what we'll come to later all right now we're going to do an example we're going to take everything that we just talked about all the geometry and we're going to apply it to an actual Hands-On example so read through this problem and draw a picture of it start by by drawing everything out every piece of it out visualize it in your mind engage with these equations think about this situation do the best job you can and write it all out and I'll give you a minute to do that so we've got two protons they move parallel to the X AIS in opposite directions so I'm going to write I'm going to draw this out too so two protons move parallel to the x axis opposite directions at the same speed V when they say speed they're not talking about the uh velocity they're talking about the magnitude speed is a magnitude not a actual Vector um and the speed is small compared to the speed of light at the instant shown find the electric and magnetic forces on the upper proton and compare their magnitudes okay so right there we already have a problem I drew this by reading the way that I read the problem I drew it a little differently than the situation is actually Illustrated so that's an important part of these problems s whenever I get an electrodynamics or magnetic problem and it doesn't have a drawing made for me that's always a problem and that's often the case especially in the worst hardest graduate level electrodynamics problems so an important Point here that I need to keep in mind when I'm writing these exam questions is I'd better be very specific more specific than this question is and give you a very clear drawing so that I'm communicating exactly what I'm talking about it's not as easy to communicate as you would think so let's redraw that so we have positive charge above and below there's a lot there's an R Vector a position Vector connecting the top pointing from the top from the bottom to the top and then we have some uh some Fields so first let's look at the we've got a we've got a we've got a charge going this way so there's a b field wrapping around as I do this and then we've got a charge going this way as well so there's a be field going this way too and then at this point here at some point since it's going all the way around at some point it's going to it's going to be coming out this way and so apparently that portion of the B field is going to be important because they took the time to draw it here in this picture so we haven't we haven't worked a lot of these problems yet so we haven't necessarily developed an intuition for why this particular B field is that too small or is that okay yes because it specifies it good question because it specifies it in the problem in the problem they say uh at the instance shown find the electric and magnetic forces on the upper proton so we're going to have to be looking at where the where the source is coming from um but you could probably get the same answer in fact you certainly could if you did it in the opposite sense you don't have to do it you don't have to pick this particular charge and do it this way you can do it the other way in Reverse just adjust your quantities correspondingly great question okay so we're going to start with our picture we've got a B field that we know is important we've got a couple of velocities one of them's minus one of them's positive now we have to go through and figure figure out how to use this this expression to actually solve this problem okay so but we have another complication because we talked about the electric field too so first we have to find the electric force on the upper proton and that's a pretty straightforward calculation so since they want to know the electric force on the upper proton we have this constant 1 over 4 Pi Epsilon KN not the same thing as Mu Epsilon is permitivity of free space and then we have q over R 2 dotted with Q so this is the this is one of the charges multiplied by the other charge so we have q doq q ^2 and that's that's from kul's law the force is the 1 over4 Pi Q over R 2 dotted with the other charge q and then the forces are repulsive and the force on the upper proton is vertically upward in the positive y direction so why is that the case why are the forces repulsive easy they're the same sign and it's going to be since it's repulsive and there the electric field line that we're talking about is this one here so if there's an e field here an electric field line and it's pushing upwards on this one so the let's see what's another good color here's another good color so the electric force I'll do my forces in this color the electric force is upward in the positive y direction so we've done the first part of our problem and we could all we have to do to get that magnitude is know the separation R so now we're talking about we're not talking about a position Vector we're just talking about a magnitude literally the the distance that the two are separated so it's magnitude r squared okay next we have to do our magnetic equation the velocity of the upper proton is V in the ihat direction we can see that if we look at our drawing again but it looks like it's in the negative IAT Direction doesn't it so why are they saying that it's in the I hat direction oh no it says lower okay good yes the velocity of the lower proton is in the ihat direction I was thinking for some reason I read that as upper okay good so the velocity of the lower proton is in the ihat direction so we can find we can use the right hand rule for the cross product V crossr that we talked about a few minutes ago and the B field due to the lower proton at the position of the upper proton is in the positive Z Direction and we can get it from the equation there so what we do is we just rewrite our equation and we think about it component by component so I've got QV I've got B first I'll write it in the vector form because it's nice to do that got our constants mu KN over 4 Pi then I've got q v now it's an a vector I hat so we're talking about the position Vector R QV QV R QV or sorry QV so V this is the what which what Vector is this IAD associated with right now which Vector in our problem somebody say it huh which which Vector is this I hat coming from v v it's V so V this is still a vector so now I can get rid of that and just write QV I had cuz I took my Vector so when you're doing this problem like this I don't actually have it let's let me rewrite this so B magnitude right we're going to we're going to start with our equation here and then we're going to have q v cross r r hat over R cubed when I take this and I actually find the component of V I'm interested in that goes away and it just becomes QV I hat so I made it a vector cross and then I have J hat okay J hat why is it J hat because it's going to be the point pointing in the direction to my target so I said let me go back and read the question one more time so we know exactly what we're doing we want to find the magnetic force on the upper proton so what we have here then is to get to get this since we're finding the magnetic force on the upper proton we have to find we have to draw a vector from our source of the magnetic field to the target the target is here so R I didn't draw all of r R goes all the way from here to here so that's our R and we can also Express that as J hat we didn't give a length they were just vague about that they just said it's in the direct it's in that direction it actually has a length to it but we don't know that length so it's enough to symbolically represent that as such so there's another important rule from these problems you won't always know the magnitude of the vectors that you're doing but you have to represent their Direction symbolically to do these to do these calculations so that's another further abstraction to note when you're doing these problems keep that in mind does what I just said make sense to everybody yes it does matter in actuality but we don't know it and we don't have any way to instantaneously calculate it we can't really break this up into its components like using the pagor theorem right off the bat in some cases we can right when we had that qvr sin Theta in that last drawing I could break up and find the magnitude of R and the direction of V but in in this case we can't really worry about that right now we just have to symbolically represent it okay now they do this thing where they put it as R squar you can do that but just know that it's actually R cubed and one of the RS cancels out the don't ever confuse yourself and think that one of those R squares cancels out because they don't does that make sense the way I wrote it here this this will turn into an R magnitude on top and then one of these R magnitudes will go away and stay in r squ in the book they don't bother to show that it's just implicitly assumed that you won't cancel out one of these RS when you take this cross product they both stay okay that's a confusing point I always want to specify that there okay great so now we have our now we have our expression what do we what do we do next next we actually take the cross product so we know from doing the cross product that and you can review the cross product and prove this to yourself later but we know that I cross J is just going to be K hat so we have I cross J is going to be K hat and then what do we still have left over QV over R 2 where R is the magnitude the separation and that's when we'll be concerned with the distance the actual magnitude of that Vector okay and then the velocity so this is let's just go back a little bit so this is lower the case for the lower okay so doe to lower doe to lower now we have the force so the velocity of the upper proton is minus V so now that we found the field now we have to go back to what we did in the last chapter okay this is a big important moment we're bridging what we learned last week with what we're doing right now so now we're going to find the magnetic force so you can see that there's several steps to this for the electric force look at how easy it is we just have this equation if we know their separation and their charges we know everything we need to know for B first we have to find what the magnetic field is going to be because it's not always going to be this simple kolom law form it could be very complicated so we have to do we have to use this rule just to get started with finding our form and then we have to take what we found and take the cross product again because remember what's the force the magnetic force due to something it's like qvb right s Theta okay so we can we can or QV cross B just keep it in the vector form QV cross B still going to have a v Vector here so that's what we're doing next so we have B and now we and we have to know q and V for the to find the force of the upper proton V is minus I hat so we have q minus v i hat so the force on the upper is magnitude is Q minus v i hat because it's actually minus I hat so we put that minus sign there cross what we just found there mu KN okay over 4 pi and then QV K hat over magnitude of R squar and then when we take that cross product we get what we get mu over 4 pi and then the q's multiply so we have q^2 V s because we have two velocities there as well over R 2 and then we have I cross K is J hat minus I cross k j hat so then here's our answer for the magnetic force so let's let's draw that in there so we've got on our electric force and we've got our magnetic force and look at this it's actually going in the same direction but the magnitudes are not the same it turns out that the electric force is much larger than the magnetic force and that's true for particles moving at slow velocities there's actually a relationship between the magnitudes of electric and magnetic fields based off of their relative velocities of the particles okay so now we have our forces magnetic and electric both in the jat direction using kum's law and our law for finding the magnetic field yes so the direction from the electric force comes from kul's law and it's remember that there's a a whole this charge has a whole bunch of positive charges pointing radially outward we're concerned with the vector that points from this charge to this charge and then we say that it's a straight line they're right above each other so it's going to be this straight line Vector here and it's going to be uh repulsive so it's going to be pointing up if it was attractive because one of these was if this one was negative it'd be downwards because it would be attractive but it's repulsive because of that so that's why it's upwards it comes from the electrostatics of the previous quarter okay all right cool okay so the magnetic interaction is also repulsive as the electric is and then we can find a ratio of their two magnitudes so we basically just take the ratio of these two I won't bother to write it out because for for sake of time but you can see that it turns into this interesting result here we it depends on the permitivity and permeability and velocity squared so that's the ratio so the electric force the magnetic force is going to be that ratio is going to increase with increasing velocity so as this goes faster and moves faster the magnetic force is going to have a bigger share of that Force ratio at slow velocities it's going to be much smaller than the electric force and then with the relationship here that we talked about before with that being 1 over c^2 the permitivity and permeability this turns into this so when V is small in comparison to the speed of light the magnetic force is much smaller than the electric force okay and it's interesting to note that we described the velocities fields and forces as they're measured by an observer who is stationary in the coordinate system uh I don't want to over complicate this so don't think about it too much but just note that what our observation point and the point the point that we consider ourselves at rest matters to this problem if we started assuming that we weren't at rest and thinking really crazy outside the box then we might come up with a paradox that would lead us to special relativity and then we would be Einstein but you know yeah okay now I want to talk about the principle of superposition of magnetic fields so the total magnetic field caused by several moving charges is the vector sum of the fields caused by the individual charges we can use this principle with the results previously to find the magnetic field produced by a current in a conductor so now we're going to do currents in a conductor so we begin by calculating the magnetic field caused by A short segment DL a little infimal bit of length of a current carrying conductor as shown in the figure I'm about to show the volume segment let me just go to there there we go okay uh oops go back a little bit so the volume segment is a DL where a is the cross-sectional area so let me let me write some of this out here okay get out a piece of paper or on your piece of paper that you already have draw this out with me so you can visualize this okay so we have we have this picture here we're going to have a little bit of DL infinitism bit of current length along this wire so DL we'll just assume it's infinitely small then we have some Field Point P here this is where we're worried about what the magnetic field is at any given calculation and then we have our R hat Vector okay and then we've got our magnetic by the right hand rule since this is a positive charge we're assuming the field at this point is going to be going out like this DB which you can see by using your right hand and the way your fingers curve around this direction which they also have Illustrated there with the hand and then later on as we go down this way the vector field is pointing in this direction downward DB so there's two different planes at this plane here this top one it's pointing curving around and then later it's pointing downwards so yeah so you can see that there okay and then um so you're going to use the right hand rule and you'll notice for these field points R and DL both lie in the beige plane and DB is perpendicular to this plane so it's just like what we did before it's very similar same kind of idea and we have some angle here between the velocity and the velocity is the current it's encapsulated in this current description and then we have an angle between our hat and here we can call it f and that's going to be important too and then here's the top view so again it's into the page just like a moving charge we're just a collection of moving charges and you can see the direction of the magnetic field so then we can come up with an expression for this infimal bit of current element basically we're taking a differential of Q and saying if we integrated we'd have the to if we inter integrated this expression we'd have the total Q so DQ Q is going to be the integral from zero to length L they don't have the integral written explicitly there but just know whenever you have a differential you can always do an integral and we have NQ and then DL so our integral is going to be over our differential length so this is the charge the location where all the charge is it's presumably these limits would be the same could be the same but they might not be if there's a if there's a length where there's not charge along all of it but typically it would be the same and then we can say that the moving charges in this segment are equivalent to a single charge DQ in infin tial bit traveling with a velocity equal to the drift velocity just the velocity of the current the average velocity and then the magnetic fields due to the random motions of the charge charges will on average cancel so technically these charges aren't going to be going all nice and perfectly straight along this wire but we're not going to worry about that we're not going to worry about the statistics of that basically it all averages out to be zero and then we have our expression from before and we have the same result now for this current carrying conductor so we just have differential magnitude it's going to be mu KN over 4 Pi uh DQ just takes the role of Q here okay and then V drift is just the velocity of the charge current sinine fi okay same thing as Sin Theta and then all that over R 2 so it's the same equation and then n q magnitude V A equals the current in the element so we have a further simplification we can just Express that that more complicated expression in terms of the current so when you have a current if I tell you I you have a much simpler expression for the magnetic field you don't have to count up all of the um individual charges and do each one individually and drive yourself crazy we've already done that with Calculus we we summed everything up in a much simpler way now we know that the differential bit of magnetic field due to the magnitude of that due to the current is Mu over 4 pi and then we've got I DL sine of pi over R 2 same idea and then if you want this to turn into B all you do is integrate DL you find it you count it all up along the length of the conductor and you're good okay and then this is just another way of stating this in Vector form so we've got the current we've got the vector length of the element that we're worried about how much length of current conductor we have and the unit Vector just like before um you could also write that as R cubed implicitly knowing that R that's going to turn into R sin F and one of those R magnitudes in the cube is going to cancel out be up with r s or just keep it that way and don't do anything to the bottom when you take when you take that cross product just leave the RS there okay this is called the bosar law it's very famous law we use this a lot in physics a lot of it in upper level physics if you take physics classes if you're a physics major you'll see this again when you take a class probably using Griffith CNM or something like that and we can use this law to find the total magnetic field at any point in space due to the current in a complete circuit so to do this we just integrate over all the elements and symbolically it's represented like this and here I have a picture of one of the most impressive beasts in nature that produces currents this this beautiful Jupiter that has some of the strongest most devastating magnetic fields known in our solar system this thing is a monster it produces a massive magnetic field many many many many times greater than Earth's magnetic field in fact it's dangerous to be around this thing there's a there's a moon that orbits it called IO and IO has been absolutely devastated by these magnetic fields they've caused these massive tidal uh forces crushing the the Moon and causing this massive volcanic activity and why is this thing so magnetic it's because it's rotating super fast it's huge right it's me it's it's I don't forget how many hundreds of times bigger than Earth it's massive but it rotates like every 10 hours it spins faster than Earth so it's got this rapid movement and then this this composition this hydrogen this liquid hydrogen and helium that's it's made up out of is an excellent conductor so you have these massive charges just going around in this in this planet and these produces huge currents and thus huge magnetic fields so when you see Jupiter next time you see it just think of it as a mad a ma a huge magnet produ producing magnet it produces mag gigantic magnetic fields from this bosar law given by that okay let's do another example um we're going to do a 10-minute break but first before we do that 10-minute break let's read over this question let's try to draw out a picture so you can think about it during the break okay I'll give everybody a chance read this over and then write it out and do a drawing of it so we have a copper wire good conductor it carries a steady current I of 125 amp to an electroplating tank um let me see if I can show you a figure of that it'll help to have the figure so there's the figure of that electr plating tank so go ahead and draw that figure out too since they gave us the figure we won't bother to read through it and try to construct it completely from words we'll also draw it out and as you're drawing this you'll notice that we we have two different field points so this is going to be one of our problems we're we're going to illustrate that actually our equation is valid not just for one point but it's valid for an infinite number of points here we've just chosen two of them to find the magnetic field strength but we could choose anywhere on this picture or in our minds anywhere and we would have some kind of field associated with it now obviously the magnetic field from Jupiter still exists here on Earth because there's no rule that I have mathematically where I say oh after a certain distance this thing just goes to zero it's still here but you'll notice that it has it typically has a 1/ r squ dependence just like our electric force and just like our gravitational force so what what essentially happens is the the magnitude of the magnetic field falls off very quickly as 1/ R 2 so in practice just like with gravitational forces we don't really talk too much about the gravitational force on us due to Jupiter we don't talk very much about the magnetic force on us due to Jupiter either unless we're talking about Jupiter's magnetic force doing something to a comet that impacts us which can happen on occasion or an asteroid okay so just going back to this question one more time uh before we take the quick break so we've got this copper wire uh carrying a steady 125 ampere current to an electroplating tank we want to find the magnetic field due to a 1 cm segment so we have our DL there uh of this wire at a point 1.2 M away from it and if the point is a at Point 1 which we showed in the drawing there which is straight out to the side of the segment and B 2 which is in the XY plane on a line at 30 degrees to the segment okay uh we'll do a 10-minute break really quick you can work on that problem think about the solution and then we'll solve it when we get back darn it hello hello all right we're back let's get started so we have our problem now let's talk about how we're going to solve this so we've got our current going this way we'll draw this draw a little sketch of this on the board here really fast current I going this way okay and then we've got two magnetic field points one back here that we're interested in and then we've got one directly above this little segment 1 cm segment one point here as well we'll call these points P1 and P2 okay so what are the magnetic fields at that point so we know that we had this expression for and you know what I'm actually going to write these out explicitly so let's write this this is our equation we're going to use DB is equal to Mu over 4 Pi okay I DL cross our R Vector that's going to be different for the two different field points and then magnitude r s okay great so now we have what we need to solve this so we have have to sort of go through and figure out let's take it Case by case we can use this we can know that this current element uh that's shown in the figure it points in a direction let's see put that on here too okay it points in this it's indicated here and it points in a specific direction see if you can see that there uh it's in the minus X Direction so the current element is going this way in the minus X so we have a minus I hat associated with that DL length there so in both cases this DL is going to have a minus I hat so we can we can start to write this out applied to our specific problem right below it U over 4 pi and then we're going to have a minus I hat corresponding that DL we going to have an i which is the current and then unit Vector R for each Field Point is directed from the current element toward that R point for P1 here it's in the positive y direction so J hat so we're going to have minus I cross J hat over r squared okay and then then what's that going to turn into so we're going to have minus I cross J hat that's going to give us a k hat but we have a negative K hat so we're going to have a minus sign an overall minus sign coming out in front of this expression sorry I have to erase this drawing a little bit so I have space here so we have minus I hat cross J hat gives us a minus KH hat so minus mu over 4 Pi i k hat over R 2 and we still have this DL associated with it as well I'll just put this little differential DL it's no longer a vector it it was a vector originally but now we have the we took the direction into account for the cross product so now it's just a length it's just the length of that so it becomes the length which is 1 cm so now we can just plug in this value here so we're going to actually get a number here so we're going to get a the MU over 4 Pi gives us 10us 7 Teslas Teslas times meters per ampere we still have a minus sign overall in front of this and now we just have our current that's in ampi that's pretty easy we just plug in the 125 amp here so this is a nice equation if we if we know our current and then our length is just 10 Theus 2 right yeah 10us 2 m and then what's our distance here they said it was 1.2 M away so we know that it's 1.2 squared meters away and put the unit in there and then let's not forget our K hat we got to do that okay so then we get minus 8.7 time 10- 8 Teslas and that's in the K hat Direction ction okay and we can also see that with the right hand rule when we do that as well okay up here going through okay so the direction of B at Point 2 is also in the XY plane so what about for Part B okay this is a little bit more involved now we have to do a little bit of geometry it's not going to be quite so simple so let's go back to our our Rule and then let's look at this let's look at this drawing here to figure out why this is more complicated and we're going to take our time on this because this is very important to get this so we're going to look at0 2 specifically so I'm going to go back and I'm going to redraw this uh this figure sorry I'm going to go back and I'm going to read draw this figure so we've got I here we got our DL I is going this way and we've got this point two like this at this angle P2 okay and then this is this is 1.2 M as well and then we've got this angle of 30° here so we've got an angle we have to take that angle into account now when we're doing this part B here okay so we go back to our law this part's not going to change mu over 4 Pi okay but then we've got I DL cross R we know DL is in the minus I Direction so we've got I DL and then there's a minus I hat that's the unit Vector for that part of it and then we've got this cross R but what's our R we have to break our R Vector up into components so we've got an R Vector pointing this way so we've got to get we've got to get this component of it and we've got to get this component of it so now we have to do a little bit of trigonometry which we've done before it's not too bad we know it's we know that this x this IAT component is going to be negative and it's going to be the cosine so it's going to be minus r cosine of 30 that's going to be IH hat right okay and um we're going to have our s of 30 for the J hat and it's positive there's not a negative there so plus r sign and I'll just leave the r off because it would be over R cubed if we didn't do that we'll keep it the way that it is in the book but just note that that's implicitly part of it okay so that's our that's our R hat so we've got cross we've got minus cosine 30 I hat so you could just think of this as minus IAT cross minus IAT plus sin 30 JH hat but if you're a little bit quick you're going to know something about some of these cross products right we're actually going to have the um what's the ihat cross the IH hat going to give you right so we know we don't have any remember we don't have any magnetic force if it's going in that direction so one of those is going to cancel out and we're just going to be left with a single K hat as our result so the cosine entry this and this is zero so this goes away and then we just have minus IAT cross J hat and that's going to give us a negative K hat so we have this this this component does not contribute this component does this component does contribute and then so to finish this off then we have mu KN over 4 Pi I DL and then it's going to be sine of 30 K hat there's a negative associated with that K hat does everybody understand how this term does not contribute and why okay great no questions about that good and then we have R SAR which we know 1.2 squared and we also know I 125 and DL so 125 amp 10 the minus 2 sin 30 K hat and we're done and we have like minus 4.3 * 10 the ne what was it 10 the8 Teslas and it's in the minus Kat Direction so it's negative okay great so now we know how to now we know sometimes we can't just take we have to always take the component that's perpendicular to the direction of the uh velocity for the r hat so when we looked at this image when we looked at that last figure we had to take the r hat and find that perpendicular component or we could just write it out in its components and then take the cross product and know that yes yes you can you can you can like you basically you just do it in your head like that term goes away and then the next term multiplies and that term does something else yes absolutely okay yes this is part B oh for so it becomes B now because here's why it's B it's not DB anymore it's B because why because we took this implicitly and we plugged in an actual length for DL so when we when we plug in in actual length we implicit do that integral then because we integrated from the length Z to the L and then so it goes from DB to D B yes okay so now we can use the bosar law to ma find the magnetic field produced by a straight current carrying conductor um this is sort of a similar idea to what we just did but now we're going to now we're going to do it from a little bit of a different perspective so now we're going to draw this figure out so I want you to draw uh the length of this draw this out on a piece of paper so you can visualize it and then we're going to go through and figure out what this will be useful for for solving certain types of current in conductor problem s okay so we have our DL here we have our origin and then this is an X axis here and then we have some Field Point P here and then our r R Vector points from some place along DL DL associated with here and then we have our R magnitude given by the Pythagorean x^2 + y^2 just a magnitude of a vector um and then we can say then that this is minus a and this is a then at Point P the field DB caused by each element of the conductor points into the plane of the page as it does for the total B field so now we're saying that the infinitism bit of magnetic field points in this direction as well so we can we can the the math goes nicely here and then um from the the figure you can see that s of f is equal to S of Pi minus 5 so that's equal to X over the magnitude of the vector and then the right hand rule for the vector product DL cross R shows the direction of DB is into the plane of the figure perpendicular to the plane so you can also see now that all of the directions of the DBS from all the elements in the conductor are the same thus integrating we can just add all the magnitudes and get a significant simplification so we couldn't necessarily do this for any arbitrary shape okay you don't have to think too hard about this but just know that this law becomes simple because of this shape if this was in a ring or something else it could be very different especially if it was an irregular shape okay so now we can put all of these pieces together and we can can actually get a really simple expression for the magnetic field due to a current carrying segment of wire and we don't have enough time to go over trig substitution that's like Cal 2 or calc 3 depending upon your sequence but we have a trigonometric integral which mathematicians love to do and we'll just note that that's what we have and you can solve this integral you get the integral by integrating this expression and using it for this current carrying wire and we have an X dy over the magnitude x^2 + y^2 that's going to be squared no it's going to be to the three halves because it's square root yeah to the three times the squ okay so we have it to the three halves that's what makes it the trig sub integral and then when we do that we're going to get a nice simplification the B field due to this is Mu I over 4 pi and then we have this integral gives us 2 a so a is the we like this because a is not a vector a is just this length so we have the length of the the rod so from negative a to a so if this was from 0 to L this integral would be different so remember that when you look at this integral it's not enough to just memorize this completely you have to look at the limits that they took when they did the integral and adjust it if it's not a it's going to be some other symbol but for this it's minus a to a so that evaluates to 2 a and then we have on the bottom just the X over < TK of x^2 + a 2 which comes about from doing the tri trig sub now when the length 2A of the conductor is much greater than its distance X from the point P we can consider it to be infinitely long so we have a further simplification when a is much longer than x the square root of x^2 + a^ 2 is just approximately equal to a hence in the limit that a goes to infinity and this is this is useful a lot of wires like if we're looking at the force for like say like communication Towers or wires from power companies we can essentially assume that they're infinite and you'll have to actually use this in the field when when power companies set up up power lines they have to be concerned with these kinds of calculations because these B fields can be dangerous if they're not done properly they can start fires and do different things so this is an important formula they actually use it in engineering maybe a little bit more sophisticated depending on the application but the basic idea is there we have a very nice simple expression for an infinitely long wire mu I over 2 pi times the distance X so when to State one more time when a is much larger than x that's the thing so we've got to be we've got to we could say we're standing here and we're looking at some power lines actually they'd be up above most likely but the idea is the same and you're and you're comparing what's the magnetic field due to these power lines or this this charge carrying uh wire or or conductor and then we can also find the direction of the magnetic field using the right hand rule from before we point our Thumb in the direction of the current and that tells us the B field so it's going to wrap around and go like that for a person here for person here it's going to be going directed this way depends on where where you're standing all right let's do an example we have a long straight conductor carries a 1 ampere current at what distance from the axis of the conductor does the resulting magnetic field have magnitude 5 * 10 to Theus 4 Teslas and that's about the Earth's magnetic field try to solve that now should be pretty easy for okay so the conductor is much greater than the distance to the field point so we can use the ideas from before and we have everything except for the Target variable the distance R so we use our formula here we rearrange things a little bit so X goes over here and B goes over here and then we've just got this expression for R so R is equal to Mu I over 2 pi b and you can plug in those values and you get the result that it's very close it's only four millimeters away so for some conductor that's infinitely long and carries a current of about 1 ampere the distance to get the magnetic field is pretty small it falls off pretty fast now we're going to talk about the magnetic field of two wires so we can have a situation where we have two wires going in with both carrying currents and they're going to exert magnetic forces on each other because they're both they're both wires so they both have Charges going in some direction Q so they have charges and they're going in if they're positive we could say they're both going in this direction pay attention to the CH charge sign whenever you're solving these problems but we want to know what what does these so for two current carrying conductors for two current carrying conductors what is the magnetic force and magnetic field caused by these two wires so we can see um a cross-sectional view of two long straight parallel wires perpendicular to the XY plane so it's not the same view that I I'm drawing here it's a it's a different view um into and out of the page but that's fine that's kind of nicer to illustrate because we can see more of the magnetic field of interest if we do it in that angle so I can redraw that in that angle too just know that these two can be roughly equivalent except in this case they'd be going in different directions so we'll make this one going this way so that we're at least having some of them going in different directions Okay so we've got wire one it's out of the page it's carrying current I and then we've got wire two it's into the page and then I can use my right hand rule to calculate um the magnetic field components for different field points so I've got this point I've got this point P1 we'll call it and how far is that away it's going to be 3D away from this point so it's 3D away from that one and then it's another um so actually let's see here yeah we have to it's it's VAR so there's this there's this sort of origin here that we call it here this is P2 and P2 is One D away from each of them so One D away from each of the wires and then we've got this point P3 which is 2D away from P2 so it's another D away from from this point so it's another D away at three and then 0 one is another 2D away from yre one so it's 2DS away from yre 1 and 3D away from0 2 but you can see that in the in the picture here so now let's find the B field at points P1 P2 and P3 and then let's find an expression for the B field at any point on the x axis to the right of wire two okay well we did it for one wire but what about two they're infinitely long so we can use that formula but how do we do it for two wires well we have to use the principle of linear superposition the principle of linear superposition says that if I have multip multiple sources of vector Fields the total Vector field is just the vector sum of those so we're going to actually calculate several magnetic fields and we're going to add those together and do it that way so let's try that now go ahead and get started with this problem working through it think about using the form formula that we just had um I can put it back on the this this R uh you could use it in this form or just B is Mu I over 2i R so B is Mu I over 2i R okay so just think about what R is is in this case for this problem we won't stay on this for too long because we have other stuff to cover so there's a another view of the B field this is this you can see doing the right hand rule so if I have the current going into my my field loops around this direction going like this into out of it's going the opposite and then we have the two Fields meeting in the center okay so in order to find the expression we use the principle of linear superposition B total is B1 plus B2 and then what is B1 B1 is minus mu I over 4 Pi D jat so B1 due to the first wire B1 is minus mu i/ 2 pi and then it's D because that's the distance away that we're looking at for the field point so since P1 is a distance 2D from y 1 and a distance 4D from y or 2 B1 is Mu I over 2 pi * 2D is equal to Mu I over 4 Pi D and B2 is Mu I over 8 Pi D both of them are in the jhat direction and we replace that r with d because that's the distance and then we add those two together and then we find that it's minus because the first one is negative it's minus mu I over 8 Pi d so one of those one of those magnetic fields is negative the other is positive the negative field is stronger than the positive component so the negative component takes over and Hales but still becomes negative for the total at point one and then at point two a distance D from both of the wires we use the same expression and then B1 and B2 are both in the positive y direction and they both and you can see that from the right hand rule they both have the same magnitude and so we just add those together and we get a nice uh expression for the total magnetic field at Point 2 and then at point three using the right hand rule we can see that B1 is in the positive y direction B2 is in the negative y direction and this point is a distance 3D from wire 1 and a distance D from wire 2 so B one contribution from that is Mu I over 2 Pi 3D so a total of mu I over 6 Pi D and that's in the jhat direction and B2 is in the negative jhat Direction mu I over 2 pi D jhat for a total of minus mu I over 3 piid in the jat direction so now we found the magnetic fields of all three points and their Direction okay we talked about finding the magnetic fields but we know from before with our charge example that's that that's not enough we also have a force due to the magnetic fields just like in the last chapter we not only have magnetic fields due to currents due to charges we also have forces on those charges same idea here so now that we know how to calculate the magnetic field produced by a long current carrying conductor we can find the magnetic force that one such conductor exerts on another and I promise you the result is going to be a little counterintuitive to what you would expect this Force plays a role in many practical situations in which current carrying wires are close to each other so we have this sort of situation where we have two long parallel conductors separated by a distance R and the magnetic field of the lower wire exerts an attractive force on the upper Wire by the same token the upper wire attracts the lower one if the wires had currents in the opposite direction they would repel each other so that's very counterintuitive because when we have like when we have opposite charges right when we have a positive and negative charge they they attract to each other so you would think intuitively that if the currents are going in the same direction they would repel not attract but that's not the case and the result actually comes from length contraction and special relativity you can show why this result happens from a physical standpoint because of how the relative velocities because these currents have different relative velocities there's they're going to experience some length contraction and they're actually seeing each other as so this wire even though these are both current carrying conductors from our perspective from their perspective because there's length contraction it sees it it's say that the top wire is positive charges because of length contraction it seem that the bottom wire is negative charged and gets attracted to it but you can't see that with this law we have to get into special relativity to show that but just know that that's the actual uh physical reasoning behind that you can show that with special relativity for this rule it just comes about from the bosar law and applying the force for current carrying conductors so here's an illustration of that and if the currents are going in opposite directions they repel for each each other so they're not always attractive if I is in the opposite direction on one of them then they're going to be repulsed the force is not going to be attractive but there you go from the right hand rule you can see that this that this is um the case now why do you what part of the magnetic force guess off the top of your head what part of the magnetic force do you think makes it so that to see it correctly you have to have relativity what do we know about Rel ity what's special about relativity that's different from other things reference frames the frame of reference is relative it doesn't matter it should be the laws of physics should be invariant it shouldn't matter what reference frame but with this magnetic force law we have we we don't have invariance we have to have a certain velocity so who the Observer is matters and that's a problem for physics and that means that in certain cases this magnetic force law won't won't won't obey Newton's Laws because it's not invariant and so this non-invariance of of the magnetic force law is partly what led Einstein to the theory of special relativity but just know for now that the velocity dependence of the magnetic force it means it's not an invariant Force none of the other forces that we think about have any velocity dependence they just depend upon the position like the electric force and the gravitational force the magnetic force shouldn't depend on the velocity either it shouldn't depend on the Observer and it doesn't when we write it in the special relativity form but in this form it does anyway that's the uh reason that these sort of relativistic effects become important in explaining some of this phenomena and behavior okay so parallel conductors carrying currents in the same direction attract each other the diagram show how the magnetic field B caused by the current in the lower conductor exerts a force on the upper conductor and from the equation we had before the lower conductor produces a b field that at the position of the upper conductor has a magnitude of this okay so now we can do our equation we had before where we had i l crossb so force is the um you know QV cross B where the L is the direction of the current I so that's your QV right QV V is q and V are built into that I and it has a magnitude L since B is perpendicular to the length of the conductor and hence to L the magnitude of the force is just I lb or mu I of 1 time the I of the other time L over 2i R and then f is the force per unit length okay now let's do a problem really quick this will be the last last problem for the day we have two straight parallel superconducting wires 4.5 mm apart and they carry equal currence of 15,000 amp in opposite directions what force per unit length does each wire exert on the other okay they're moving in opposite directions so are they going to be attractive or repulsive okay great I heard the r repulsive okay so solve this really quick we've got uh about four minutes total oh yeah there's one more thing while you're solving this if anybody does not have access to the mastering physics homework let me know and then also how many of you are getting only three attempts per problem because it should be a lot more okay there's only a few people I do not know why some people have the wrong number of attempts that I didn't specify for the software how could it have so many like irrelevant problems coming up all right so just so you know if you only get three attempts for the mastering physics homework as long as you have it you'll get full credit as long as you attempt the homework if that's an issue though for you because you want to see the solution or have more attempts let me know I don't know why that problem exists for a few people but I keep getting that email as long as you have access to the mastering physics though all the homeworks and there's only one homework right now I'm going to assign more homework now that we've done this lecture but um anyway just know that attempting the homeworks and doing the problems yourself will get you full credit because that's what I want I don't want people copying Solutions I want people to try it make mistakes learn and then you get the full credit for the process and then you demonstrate that knowledge on the quiz also the quiz is going to be next week I I posted the date and I've made an announcement so if anybody has any questions about that that's been posted as well all right let's go over the solution real quick okay so we have a picture of this case and we have the distance that they're separated from each other so now we can do F per unit length and we have that formula so we have mu not times the currents I and I prime that's just the the notation for the two different currents they're the same so they multiply together and then we've got over 2i R so we get a really large Force actually so if we have really large currents we're going to have really strong forces going and and that's interesting because at CERN and this place I talked about earlier we have protons moving extremely extremely fast so it's a significant current but it is only a few charges so you know you have to wait that with the total uh magnitude of the charge comes into play so there's not a lot of them but still there's a significant magnetic field generated and that has to be taken into account when their the directions are being oriented okay so that's um all that I have for today I'll post these lecture slides I'm going to have office hours right after this everybody have a great day
